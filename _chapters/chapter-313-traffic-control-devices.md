## 313.01   Obedience to traffic control devices

1. _(a)_ No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.

    No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
    enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
    violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently
    legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular
    section of this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that
    section shall be effective even though no signs are erected or in place.

2. _(b)_ Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.  
If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section 303.991 of the Traffic Code.  
(ORC 4511.12)

## 313.02   Through streets; stop and yield right-of-way signs

1. _(a)_ All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.  
Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
2. _(b)_ Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices.
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
3. _(c)_ Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
4. _(d)_ Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
    2. _(2)_ Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:

has no meaning and shall not be used.
5. _(e)_ Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
    1. _(1)_
        1. _(A)_ Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1. _(1)_ Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2. _(2)_ Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
        2. _(B)_ In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the

the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
    3. _(3)_ Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
    4. _(4)_ When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
6. _(f)_ Flashing Red Signal Indication:
    1. _(1)_ Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
    2. _(2)_ Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or

conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
    2. _(2)_ A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
    3. _(3)_ A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
