## 545.02   Determining property value in theft offense

1. _(a)_ If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

2. _(b)_

    1. _(1)_ When a series of offenses under Section 545.05, or a series of
    violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
    or complicity in violations of Section 545.05, 545.06, or 545.08,
    545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section 545.15 or 545.20 involving a victim who is
    an elderly person or disabled adult, is committed by the offender in the
    offender's same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of
    those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a series of offenses
    under Section 545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
    violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of
    Sections 545.05 or 545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service
    member or spouse of an active duty service member is committed by the
    offender in the offender's same employment, capacity or relationship to
    another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value
    of the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the
    purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and
    services involved in all offenses in the series.

    2. _(2)_ If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section 545.05
    that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
    the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
    for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
    violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of
    Section 545.05, 545.06 or 545.08, Section 545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
    545.15 or 545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one
    victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
    pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be
    tried as a single offense. If the offender is being tried for the commission
    of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
    conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section 545.05 or
    545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
    involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
    active duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of
    those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried
    as a single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the
    purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and
    services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.

    3. _(3)_ In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
    is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
    Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a
    given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's
    same employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in
    subsection (b)(1) of this section or that involve a common course of
    conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as
    described in subsection (b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to
    separately allege and prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute
    a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary
    in prosecuting them as a single offense to prove the aggregate value of the
    property or services in order to meet the requisite statutory offense level
    sought by the prosecution.

3. _(c)_ The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:

    1. _(1)_ The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
    museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
    worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only
    on the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that
    would compensate the owner for its loss.

    2. _(2)_ The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
    materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession,
    business, trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not
    covered under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial
    utility for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of
    replacing the property with new property of like kind and quality.

    3. _(3)_ The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
    under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the
    fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
    "fair market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a
    seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
    willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully
    informed as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is
    under any compulsion to act.

4. _(d)_ Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

    1. _(1)_ When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
    wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
    prima-facie evidence of its value.

    2. _(2)_ When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
    exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked
    price, given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is
    prima-facie evidence of the value of the security or commodity.

    3. _(3)_ When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
    agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the
    latest local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of
    the value of the livestock, poultry or products.

    4. _(4)_ When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
    value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.

    5. _(5)_ When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
    pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer
    to receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value
    of the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to
    receive the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
    instrument.

    6. _(6)_ When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
    transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
    bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no
    face value, the value of the property or services that may be received by
    the instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.

    7. _(7)_ When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
    transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established
    by law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of
    the services.

    8. _(8)_ When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
    established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense
    of the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
    manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential
    offenders, the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the
    value of the services.\
