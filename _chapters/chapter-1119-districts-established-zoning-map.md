(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1119.02   Zoning map

The aforesaid districts are designated by symbols and the locations and
boundaries of such districts are established on the Map entitled "Zoning Map of
the Municipality of Chagrin Falls, or the Village of Chagrin Falls Zoning Map",
or similar title and referred to in the Planning and Zoning Code as the Map or
Zoning Map. The notations, schedules and other information shown thereon and all
amendments thereto are hereby made a part of this Planning and Zoning Code. The
Map shall indicate the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission and
adoption by Council. The Map, or a print thereof, shall be on file with the
Clerk of Council and the Administrator and shall be the final authority as to
the status of current zoning map districts.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1119.03   District boundary lines

The district boundary lines of the Map enclose an area of a designated district,
and generally follow the center lines of streets, alleys, and lot lines or their
extensions, provided, however:

1. _(a)_ Where a district boundary line is shown by dimension or relationship as
being located a specific distance from and parallel to a street or property
line, such distance shall control;

2. _(b)_ Where a district boundary line is shown as adjoining a railroad, it
shall, unless otherwise fixed, be construed to coincide with the nearest
boundary line of the railroad right of way;

3. _(c)_ Where a district boundary line divides a parcel of land, the location
of such boundary, unless related to fixed points on the property boundary, shall
be determined by scale, and the parts of the lot shall comply with the
regulations of the district in which each part is located;

4. _(d)_ Where a district boundary line does not coincide with any of the
aforesaid lines, and where it is not located by dimensions or fixed points shown
on the Map, it shall be determined by the scale appearing thereon.

5. _(e)_ In locations where the Administrator cannot determine the district line
in accordance with the above rules, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine
the exact location.

6. _(f)_ Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official
action of Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley
or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation and
all areas included in the vacation shall then be subject to all appropriate
regulations of the extended district.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1119.04   Annexed territory

All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the Municipality if already
zoned shall be continued in its existing zone classification until amended in
conformance with the procedure outlined in this Planning and Zoning Code.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
