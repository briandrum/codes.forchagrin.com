to determine, the following:

based on Ohio R.C. 2905.05, Criminal Child Enticement. The Ohio Supreme Court
held that Ohio R.C. 2905.05(A) was unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of

## 537.18   Contributing to unruliness or delinquency of a child

    1. _(1)_ “Delinquent child” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2152.02.
    2. _(2)_ “Unruly child” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2151.022.
2. _(b)_ No person, including a parent, guardian or other custodian of a child,

(ORC 2919.24)

## 537.19   Hazing

1. _(a)_ As used in this section, "hazing" means doing any act or coercing
another, including the victim, to do any act, of initiation into any student or
other organization, which act causes or creates a substantial risk of causing
mental or physical harm to any person.
2. _(b)_ No person shall recklessly participate in the hazing of another.
3. _(c)_ No administrator, employee or faculty member of any primary,
secondary or post-secondary school, or of any other educational institution,
public or private, shall recklessly permit the hazing of any person. (ORC
2903.31)
4. _(d)_ Any person who is subjected to hazing, as defined in subsection (a)
hereof, may commence a civil action for injury or damages, including mental and
physical pain and suffering that result from the hazing. The action may be
brought against any participants in the hazing, any organization whose local or
national directors, trustees or officers authorized, requested, commanded or
tolerated the hazing, and any local or national director, trustee or officer of
the organization who authorized, requested, commanded or tolerated the hazing.
If the hazing involves students in a primary, secondary or post-secondary
school, university, college or any other educational institution, an action may
also be brought against any administrator, employee or faculty member of the
school, university, college or other educational institution who knew or
reasonably should have known of the hazing and who did not make reasonable
attempts to prevent it and against the school, university, college or other
educational institution. If an administrator, employee or faculty member is
found liable in a civil action for hazing, then notwithstanding Ohio R. C.
Chapter 2743, the school, university, college or other educational institution
that employed the administrator, employee or faculty member may also be held
liable.  
The negligence or consent of the plaintiff or any assumption of the risk by
the plaintiff is not a defense to an action brought pursuant to this section.

institution, it is an affirmative defense that the school, university, college
or other institution was actively enforcing a policy against hazing at the time
the cause of action arose.

hazing, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
