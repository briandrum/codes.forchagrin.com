determines that such tree is infected with either of such diseases, he may, if
the tree is in any public street, ground or way within the Municipality,
immediately remove and burn the same in such manner as to prevent as fully
as possible the spread of such disease. If such tree is located on private
property, the Chief Administrative Officer may immediately serve upon the owner
of such property a written notice that such tree is so infected and the same
must be removed and burned under the supervision of the Chief Administrative
Officer within five days of the service of such notice. If such owner cannot be
found, a copy of the notice shall be posted upon the infected tree. If the tree
is not so removed and burned within five days after the service or posting of

removed and burned.

Officer may forward specimens from such tree for complete examination,
diagnosis and report to either the Ohio State Outlying Agricultural Research
Station in Wooster, Ohio, or to the United States Agricultural Research Center
in Beltsville, Maryland, or to their successor agencies regardless of where
they may be located, and the action of the Chief Administrative Officer under
this chapter shall await and be determined by the report received from such
examination and diagnosis.
