## 541.01   Determining property value in arson

1. _(a)_ The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section 541.02.

    1. _(1)_ If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
    museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
    irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
    effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
    involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.

    2. _(2)_ If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
    the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
    its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
    cost of restoring the property.

    3. _(3)_ If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
    the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially
    to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
    property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like
    kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
    fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
    immediately before and immediately after the offense.

2. _(b)_ As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as in
Section 545.02(c)(3).

3. _(c)_ Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.\

    2. _(2)_ It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
    this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.

3. _(c)_ Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

conduct, interrupts or causes the delay of the live performance, sporting event,
or other activity taking place at the place of public amusement. This subsection

    a portion of a place of public amusement.
