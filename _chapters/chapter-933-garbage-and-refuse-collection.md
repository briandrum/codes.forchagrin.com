## 933.01   Receptacles for refuse

The owner, agent, lessee or occupant of any building where refuse is
produced or permitted to accumulate shall provide one or more receptacles
therefor and shall maintain each such receptacle in good condition so that the

capacity of not less than five nor more than twenty-five gallons and shall be
provided with suitable handles.

No refuse shall be placed or permitted to remain elsewhere than in
receptacles.

## 933.02   Preparation of refuse 

All refuse shall be drained of excess fluid by householder and wrapped in
paper. Refuse so wrapped shall be placed in the container provided by the
householder therefor.

## 933.03   Location of refuse receptacles

No person shall place or maintain any receptacle for refuse so that it will
constitute a nuisance. Receptacles for refuse shall not be located within a
building.

## 933.04   Regulations

Refuse shall be set out in proper containers on collection day, on the
treelawn, by 7:00 a.m. in accordance with the rule for collection of the
Municipality. Containers which are set out for collection shall be promptly
removed therefrom after the same have been emptied. When refuse has been set
out on a public street or area for collection, no person except personnel
authorized by the Municipality shall remove any of the refuse. When refuse has
been set out on private premises, no person shall remove any refuse therefrom
except with the consent or at the direction of the owner or lessee of the
premises.

Brush, limbs and similar materials shall not be accepted for municipal
collection unless such materials are securely tied in bundles not exceeding
fifty pounds in weight and three feet in length. Newspapers must be tied.

## 933.05   Rules

The Mayor is authorized to prepare and publish rules for the effective

refuse collection between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Application for
an exception shall be made on a form provided by the Chief of Police and shall
be granted only when the applicant is able to demonstrate circumstances of
great practical difficulty in the collection and transportation of garbage due
