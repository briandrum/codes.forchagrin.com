## 171.01   Move to amend day

Beginning in the year 2021, and each odd numbered year thereafter, the Village
Council shall designate one (1) day, within the first fifteen (15) days of
March, as "Move to Amend Day". On this day, the Village Council shall sponsor a
public meeting to study the impact on the Village of political influence by
corporate entities, including unions and political action committees, in
connection with the most recent national, state and local elections. Members of
the general public shall be afforded the opportunity to speak on these matters
for up to five (5) minutes per person. The Village shall record the minutes of
the meeting and make them available to the public by posting them on the
Village’s website.  
(Ord. 2021-08. Passed 2-8-21.)

## 171.02   Summary of public hearing

Within one (1) week following the biennial public hearing, the Clerk of Village
Council shall send a letter to the leaders of the Ohio House and Senate, to our
U.S. Congressional Representative, and to both Ohio Senators. The letter will
include a brief summary of the public hearing and will state that the citizens
of the Village of Chargin Falls in November 2014 voted in support of a Citizens’
Initiative calling for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution declaring:

1. _(a)_ Only human beings, not corporations, are legal persons with
Constitutional rights, and

2. _(b)_ Money is not equivalent to speech, and therefore regulating political
contributions and spending does not equate to limiting political speech.  
(Approval by voters 11-4-14)

## 171.03   Termination of public hearing

The biennial Public Hearings will no longer be required if and when a
Constitutional Amendment reflecting the principles set forth in Section 171.02
is ratified by three-quarters (3/4) of the State legislatures.  
(Approval by voters 11-4-14)
