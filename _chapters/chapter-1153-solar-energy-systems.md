## 1153.01   Intent

In addition to the applicable provisions of the intent stated in [Section
1105.03][], it is the intent of these regulations to provide for the placement
of solar energy systems to achieve the following objectives:

1. _(a)_ To regulate the construction, modification, operation and abandonment
of solar energy systems;

2. _(b)_ To require solar energy systems to meet reasonable standards that will
protect the public health, safety, and welfare while preserving the enjoyment of
private property;

3. _(c)_ To minimize the adverse impacts of solar energy systems on contiguous
properties and on the aesthetic quality of the Municipality; and,

4. _(d)_ To promote orderly land use, and development while allowing the safe,
effective, and efficient use of solar energy systems.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1153.02   Definitions

1. _(a)_ "Abandonment" means the discontinued use of the solar energy generation
system in whole or part.

2. _(b)_ "Solar array" means any collection of solar panels, connectors, battery
banks, controllers, wiring, meters, and switching devices intended to work in
combination to convert solar energy to electrical power.

3. _(c)_ "Solar cell" means the basic photovoltaic device that generates
electricity when exposed to light.

4. _(d)_ "Solar energy system" means the photovoltaic cells and related
accessories that are designed to convert solar energy into electrical energy; or
a system consisting of solar thermal collectors, parabolic reflectors, or
similar structures that are designed to harness solar energy for use as thermal
energy for heating water or air and may include battery storage systems.

5. _(e)_ "Solar panel" means any device used for collecting solar energy and
converting it to electrical power.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1153.03   Applicability

1. _(a)_ Solar energy systems shall be designed, erected, installed, operated,
and maintained in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Chapter.

2. _(b)_ A Building Permit and Electrical Permit shall be required prior to the
erection, installation, connection, or operation of any solar energy system.

3. _(c)_ Like-kind replacements, minor repairs or maintenance of lawfully
existing solar energy systems not involving structural changes may be undertaken
without first obtaining a permit.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1153.04   Application requirements

In addition to the application requirements set forth in [Section 1109.04][CF
Section 1109.04], an application for a solar energy system shall include:

1. _(a)_ The manufacturer's specifications.

2. _(b)_ Complete architectural and engineering drawings, adequately scaled and
dimensioned depicting the location, installation, mounting, anchorage details,
appearance on the building and details for wiring and connections, and battery
storage system details.

3. _(c)_ Details for battery storage systems regarding:

    1. _(1)_ Location of equipment

    2. _(2)_ Ventilation

    3. _(3)_ Containment

    4. _(4)_ Supporting structures for batteries and equipment

    5. _(5)_ Electrical system, devices and wiring

4. _(d)_ Evidence that the proposed system has been reviewed by the Chagrin
Falls Bureau of Fire Prevention and its findings and recommendations are
submitted with the application.

5. _(e)_ Verification that the installer has the necessary professional
training, North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP)
certification and licensure as may be required for the installation of solar
energy systems.

6. _(f)_ Certification by a licensed structural engineer that the roof of the
building is designed to handle all structural loads including those imposed by
the proposed solar panel system.

7. _(g)_ Evidence that the local public electric utility company approves the
applicant's intent to install an interconnected customer-owned system if the
proposed system is to interconnect to a local utility grid.

8. _(h)_ A description of the location and type of any required screening.

9. _(i)_ A description of emergency and normal shutdown procedures and location
of electrical disconnection switch.

10. _(j)_ Payment of the fee as required by Chapter 1309 of the Building Code.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1153.05   General requirements

1. _(a)_ Solar energy systems shall be permitted as accessory to a main use or
building located on the same lot or parcel. Such facilities shall be designed,
installed, or constructed to provide electrical power to be primarily consumed
by the main use or building to which they are accessory.

2. _(b)_ The Architectural Board of Review shall review solar energy systems
applications for compliance with the Building Code, general design standards,
and design standards established in this Planning and Zoning Code.

3. _(c)_ Solar panels shall be placed on the roof of a building in accordance
with the following:

    1. _(1)_ Solar panels shall not be visible from any street or sidewalk at
    the front elevation of the property unless approved in accordance with
    procedures set forth in subsection (d) herein.

    2. _(2)_ Solar panels shall not extend beyond the edge of the roof.

    3. _(3)_ For pitched roofs (sloped in excess of three (3) inches per foot),
    solar panels shall be placed parallel to the plane of pitched roof and shall
    be ten (10) inches or less above the surface of the roof when measured to
    the top of the solar panel.

    4. _(4)_ For low slope (pitches less than three (3) inches per foot) and
    flat roofs, the Architectural Board of Review may approve solar panels of
    alternative heights and configurations as appropriate for such roof.

4. _(d)_ The Architectural Board of Review may approve the placement of solar
panels in roof locations that are visible from any street or sidewalk, when the
applicant has demonstrated to the Architectural Board of Review that:

    1. _(1)_ The alternative location is necessary to optimize system
    functionality;

    2. _(2)_ The proposed panel(s) and their location(s) are designed to
    minimize any adverse impacts to the neighborhood; and/or,

    3. _(3)_ The size and location of any structure is the minimum necessary to
    serve the needs of the building(s) on the property.

5. _(e)_ When locating a solar panel, it is the property owner's responsibility
to consider current and future development, growth of trees and vegetation, and
other obstructions that might interfere with solar access. Nothing in this
section shall prohibit the owner of the solar energy system from requesting or
obtaining a solar access easement from any person.

6. _(f)_ Solar access easements shall be in compliance with Ohio R.C.
[5301.63][ORC Section 5301.63] which sets forth the requirements for solar
access. In order to ensure adequate access of solar energy collection devices to
sunlight, any person may grant a solar access easement. Such easements shall be
in writing and subject to the same conveyance and recording requirements as
other easements. Any instrument creating a solar easement shall be recorded in
the Cuyahoga County Recorder's Office.

7. _(g)_ Solar panels and related equipment shall be located, oriented or
screened and constructed of such material to prevent to the fullest extent
practicable glare from solar panels to not be directed at any other person,
building or public right of way.

8. _(h)_ Solar panels shall be uniform in appearance and color, and to the
extent practicable, match the design and color of the roof on which the panels
will be placed.

9. _(i)_ Accessory components shall be located either within a building, or
within a screened enclosure behind the main building, or are hidden from view
behind the parapet wall of buildings with flat roofs.

10. _(j)_ Solar energy systems shall be properly maintained at all times in
compliance with all manufacturers' specifications.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1153.06   Abandonment

Upon abandonment, the owner shall physically remove the solar energy system
within sixty (60) days from the date of abandonment. "Physically remove" shall
include, but not be limited to:

1. _(a)_ Removal of the solar energy system and related above grade structures.

2. _(b)_ Restoration of the location of the solar energy system to its prior
condition.\
