    1. _(1)_ No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C. 4507.03,
    4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public road or
    highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
    vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a
    valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. [Chapter 4507][ORC Chapter
    4507] or a commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. [Chapter
    4506][ORC Chapter 4506].

    4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public
    road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
    purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the
    person has a valid license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon
    application by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. [Chapter
    4507][ORC Chapter 4507]. The license shall be in the form of an endorsement,
    as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's or commercial driver's
    license, if the person has a valid license to operate a motor vehicle or
    commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted license as provided
    in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid license to operate
    a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

2. _(b)_ Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a noncertified
copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a noncertified copy
of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the name, date of
birth, and social security number of a person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid driver's or
commercial driver's license at the time of the alleged violation of subsection
(a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator either in the
form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial driver's license or a
restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a)(2) of
this section. The person charged with a violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of
this section may offer evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

3. _(c)_ Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle or
motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:

    1. _(1)_ If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
    driver's or commercial driver's license issued by this state or any other
    jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
    offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
    operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial
    driver's license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
    provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.
    When the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be
    sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender
    shall not be sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced
    to a community residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26;

    (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be ordered pursuant to
    division (C) of that section to serve a term of community service of up to
    five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of
    community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal
    contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the
    underlying case. If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
    guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent
    municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

    2. _(2)_ If the offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit
    or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
    offender's driver's or commercial driver's license bearing the motorcycle
    endorsement or the offender's restricted license was expired at the time of
    the offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is
    a minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
    previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations
    of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
    offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

4. _(d)_ The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

5. _(e)_ If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender's license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.\

issued under Ohio R.C. [Chapter 4506][ORC Chapter 4506].

    temporary instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person
    by another jurisdiction recognized by this state.

    2. _(2)_ The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
    instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority,
    together with information that the license, temporary instruction permit, or
    identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
    registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
    identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.

    3. _(3)_ No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary
    instruction permit, or identification card at any time.\
    (ORC 4507.02(A))

3. _(c)_

    subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

    community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal
    contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the
    underlying case. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
    previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations

restraining device.

5. _(e)_ Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,

violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.

6. _(f)_ Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
