costs incurred shall, when approved by Council, be paid out of municipal funds
not otherwise appropriated. Council shall make a written return to the County
Auditor of its action, with a statement of the charges for its services, the
amount paid for labor, the fees of the officers serving such notice and a proper
description of the premises. Such amounts, when allowed, shall be entered upon
the tax duplicate and be a lien upon such lands from and after the date of the

1. _(a)_ It is the purpose of this section to provide for and promote the
health, safety and welfare of the general public, including those who wish to
use skateboards, roller blades and roller skates on public streets and
sidewalks, as well as those who drive motor vehicles, and pedestrians who use

    It is the specific intent of this section that none of its provisions are
    intended to impose any duty whatsoever upon the Village, or any of its

    section shall be discretionary and not mandatory.  

    The Village discourages the use of any skateboards, roler blades, or roller
    skates on the public streets or sidewalks of the Village for the reason that
    same poses a potential risk and harm to those performing such activities in
    the vicinity of motor vehicles, as well as to pedestrians who are walking on
    the sidewalks. However, the Village defers to the good judgment of parents
    and guardians in controlling the proper use of such items by their children
    or charges in such a manner as to protect their own safety as well as the
    safety of others. Nothing contained in this section is intended nor shall be
    construed to create or form the basis of any liability on the part of the
    Village, or its officers, employees or agents, for any injury or damage
    resulting from any action or inaction on the part of the Village related in
    any manner to the adoption and/or enforcement of this section of the Code.

2. _(b)_ “Skateboard” means any platform device designed and intended to move or
propel one or more riders over a hard surface by means of roller wheels
utilizing gravity or human impetus. “Roller skates” and “roller blades” means
any device fitted upon the human foot designed and intended to propel persons
over hard surfaces by means of roller wheels utilizing gravity or human impetus.

3. _(c)_ No person shall ride a skateboard or wear roller blades or roller skate
devices upon public property within any retail or central business district of
the Village, nor shall any person ride a skateboard or wear roller blades or
roller skate devices upon any arterial public street or adjacent sidewalk
anywhere within the Village corporate limits, which includes the following

skateboard or wearing roller blades or roller skate devices, shall operate on
sidewalks, or public streets where no sidewalks exist, in single file as near to
the right side of the sidewalk or roadway as is practical and shall exercise due
care when passing or meeting other persons or property upon such sidewalk or
public street area.

6. _(f)_ Every person riding a skateboard or wearing roller blades or roller
skate devices shall yield the right of way to all pedestrians at all times and
shall pass them, without causing injury or reasonable fear for their safety,
even if dismounting or the cessation of locomotion shall be necessary.

7. _(g)_ Every person riding a skateboard shall dismount a skateboard at a
street intersection and shall walk as a pedestrian across such intersection.

8. _(h)_ No person shall ride a skateboard or wear roller blades or roller skate
devices on public streets or sidewalks after sunset and before sunrise without
