        violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense,
        that is vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine
        withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
        R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered
        with any other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt
        or innocence of the defendant.

        2. _(B)_ In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
        violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent
        offense that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the
        concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances,
        metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination of them in the
        defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or other
        bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
        chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the
        time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in
        this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
        affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
        maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical
        test or tests as described in that section.

            The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs
            of abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when
            a person submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance
            test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C.
            4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a
            search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an emergency
            medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
            technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
            phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of
            determining the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a
            controlled substance, or combination content of the whole blood,
            blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to the
            taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw
            blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
            subsection, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
            person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily
            substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
            analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of
            Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the
            Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.

        3. _(C)_ As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, "emergency
        medical technician-intermediate" and "emergency medical
        technician-paramedic" have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.

    2. _(2)_ In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
    violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense
    that is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was
    withdrawn a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of
    alcohol specified in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or
    less than the applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a
    listed metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of
    subsection (a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other
    competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
    This subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile
    court proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
    equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.

    3. _(3)_ Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
    chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's
    attorney, immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If
    the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
    person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
    technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer
    a chemical test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any
    administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
    under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
    arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
    person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person's own
    expense. If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
    (5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested,
    as required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have
    an independent test performed at the person's expense. The failure or
    inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not
    preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests
    taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

    4. _(4)_

        1. _(A)_ As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
        "national highway traffic safety administration" means the National
        Traffic Highway Safety Administration established as an administration
        of the United States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415
        (1983), 49 U.S.C.A. 105.

        2. _(B)_ In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
        violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
        ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of
        alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a
        municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited
        concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
        controlled substance in the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath
        or urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety
        test to the operator or person in physical control of the vehicle
        involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing
        evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
        compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and
        generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time
        the tests were administered, including, but not limited to, any testing
        standards then in effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic
        Safety Administration, all of the following apply:

            1. _(1)_ The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
            sobriety test so administered.

            2. _(2)_ The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
            sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the
            criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.

            3. _(3)_ If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
            subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or
            evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall
            admit the testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it
            whatever weight the trier of fact considers to be appropriate.

        3. _(C)_ Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude
        a court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was
        supported by probable cause or its determination of any other matter in
        a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described
        in that subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not
        otherwise disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.\

        designee of the director that contains the name of each certified
        analyst or test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or
        test performer's employment relationship with the laboratory that issued
        the report, and a notation that performing an analysis of the type
        involved is part of the analyst's or test performer's regular duties;

        4. _(D)_ An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
        training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and

        control standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under
        rules of the Department of Health.

    2. _(2)_ Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
    of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
    section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
    proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding,
    unless the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's
    attorney or, if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.

    3. _(3)_ A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
    shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of
    any substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report
    pertains or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the
    defendant or the defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person
    who signed the report. The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time

7. _(g)_ Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and
civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim
that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood
from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to an
emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.

    As used in this subsection, "emergency medical technician-intermediate" and
    "emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the same meanings as in Ohio
    R.C. 4765.01.

8. _(h)_ **General OVI Penalty.**

    1. _(1)_ Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
    (2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
    alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates
    subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
    under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite
    of a controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either
    offense under Ohio R.C. [Chapter 2929][ORC Chapter 2929], and this Traffic
    Code, except as otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to
    E. of this section:

        1. _(A)_ Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
        E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
        degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the
        following:

            1. _(1)_ If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
            subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a
            mandatory jail term of three consecutive days. As used in this
            subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two consecutive
            hours. The court may sentence an offender to both an intervention
            program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term in
            addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention
            program. However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed
            for the offense exceed six months.

                The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term
                under this subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended
                term, places the offender under a community control sanction
                pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires the offender to
                attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers' intervention
                program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.

                The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
                three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the
                offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio
                R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the offender
                to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers'
                intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to
                a jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days
                that the offender does not spend attending the program. The
                court may require the offender, as a condition of community
                control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers'
                intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any
                treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
                standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. [Chapter 5119][ORC
                Chapter 5119] by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction
                Services that the operators of the drivers' intervention program
                determine that the offender should attend and to report
                periodically to the court on the offender's progress in the
                programs. The court also may impose on the offender any other
                conditions of community control that it considers necessary. If
                the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
                offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon
                the offender by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this
                section for the offense apply, except that the court shall
                suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the
                court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting
                unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C.
                4510.022.

            2. _(2)_ If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
            subsection (a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except
            as otherwise provided in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of
            at least three consecutive days and a requirement that the offender
            attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers' intervention program
            that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. As used in this
            subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two consecutive
            hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive to
            treatment in a drivers' intervention program, if the offender
            refuses to attend a drivers' intervention program, or if the jail at
            which the offender is to serve the jail term imposed can provide a
            drivers' intervention program, the court shall sentence the offender
            to a mandatory jail term of at least six consecutive days.

                If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
                offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon
                the offender by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this
                section for the offense apply, except that the court shall
                suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the
                court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting
                unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C.
                4510.022.

                The court may require the offender, under a community control
                sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and
                satisfactorily complete any treatment or education programs that
                comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C.
                [Chapter 5119][ORC Chapter 5119] by the Director of Mental
                Health and Addiction Services, in addition to the required
                attendance at drivers' intervention program, that the operators
                of the drivers' intervention program determine that the offender
                should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
                offender's progress in the programs. The court also may impose
                any other conditions of community control on the offender that
                it considers necessary.

            3. _(3)_ In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred
            seventy- five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand
            seventy-five dollars ($1,075).

            4. _(4)_ In all cases, a suspension of the offender's driver's or
            commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
            privilege for a definite period of one to three years. The court may
            grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under
            Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited
            driving privileges with an ignition interlock device relative to the
            suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as authorized
            under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

        2. _(B)_ Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
        section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously
        has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection
        (a) or (b) of this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of
        a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender
        to all of the following:

            1. _(1)_ If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
            subsection (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a
            mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days. The court shall impose
            the ten-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
            subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
            sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a
            term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
            alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
            continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in
            addition to the ten-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail
            term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.

                In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with
                electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both
                types of monitoring and jail term, the court shall require the
                offender to be assessed by a community addiction services
                provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
                subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to
                follow the treatment recommendations of the services provider.
                The purpose of the assessment is to determine the degree of the
                offender's alcohol usage and to determine whether or not
                treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court, the
                services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to
                the court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical
                diagnoses related to alcohol use.

            2. _(2)_ If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
            subsection (a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except
            as otherwise provided in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of
            twenty consecutive days. The court shall impose the twenty-day
            mandatory jail term under this subsection unless, subject to
            subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
            under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
            house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
            monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous
            alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
            the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed
            for the offense shall not exceed six months.

                In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with
                electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both
                types of monitoring and jail term, the court shall require the
                offender to be assessed by a community addiction services
                provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
                subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to
                follow the treatment recommendations of the services provider.
                The purpose of the assessment is to determine the degree of the
                offender's alcohol usage and to determine whether or not
                treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court, the
                services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to
                the court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical
                diagnoses related to alcohol use.

            3. _(3)_ In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in
            Section 303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five
            dollars ($525.00) and not more than one thousand six hundred
            twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

            4. _(4)_ In all cases, a suspension of the offender's driver's
            license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
            probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for a
            definite period of one to seven years. The court may grant limited
            driving privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C.
            4510.021 and 4510.13.\
            (ORC 4511.19)

            5. _(5)_ In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the
            offender's name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the
            offense for ninety days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and
            impoundment of the license plates of that vehicle for ninety days.\
            (ORC 4511.193)

        3. _(C)_ Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
        section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously
        has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection
        (a) or (b) of this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a
        misdemeanor. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the
        following:

            1. _(1)_ If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
            subsection (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a
            mandatory jail term of thirty consecutive days. The court shall
            impose the thirty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
            unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead
            imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail
            term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
            continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring
            and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term
            in addition to the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding
            the jail terms set forth in Section 303.99, the additional jail term
            shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative jail term imposed for
            the offense shall not exceed one year.

            2. _(2)_ If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of

            impose the sixty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
            unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead
            imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail
            term and a term of electronically monitored house arrest with
            continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring
            and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term
            in addition to the sixty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding
            the terms of imprisonment set forth in Section 303.99, the
            additional jail term shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative
            jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.

            3. _(3)_ In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in

            (ORC 4511.19)

            5. _(5)_ In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the
            offender's name, criminal forfeiture of the vehicle involved in the
            offense in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Subsection (h)(5) of
            this section applies regarding any vehicle that is subject to an
            order of criminal forfeiture under this subsection.\
            (ORC 4511.193)

            6. _(6)_ In all cases, the court shall order the offender to
            participate with a community addiction services provider authorized
            by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and
            shall order the offender to follow the treatment recommendations of
            the services provider. The operator of the services provider shall
            determine and assess the degree of the offender's alcohol dependency
            and shall make recommendations for treatment. Upon the request of
            the court, the services provider shall submit the results of the
            assessment to the court, including all treatment recommendations and
            clinical diagnoses related to alcohol use.

        4. _(D)_ Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
        section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously
        has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or four violations of
        subsection (a) or (b) of this section or other equivalent offenses or an
        offender who, within twenty years of the offense, previously has been
        convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or more violations of that nature
        is guilty of a felony of the fourth degree and shall be prosecuted under
        appropriate state law.

        5. _(E)_ An offender who previously has been convicted of or pleaded
        guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) that was a felony,
        regardless of when the violation and the conviction or guilty plea
        occurred, is guilty of a felony of the third degree and shall be
        prosecuted under appropriate state law.

    2. _(2)_ An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
    subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of
    the driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident
    operating privilege suspended under this section as a result of the
    conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in
    division (F)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191.

    3. _(3)_ If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
    (1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days
    of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the
    record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
    offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to
    begin serving that term within the sixty-day period following the date of
    sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence under this
    subsection that includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring,
    with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
    continuous alcohol monitoring.

        As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days
        required by subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this
        subsection, may sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail
        and not less than eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with
        electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
        electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The cumulative
        total of the five consecutive days in jail and the period of house
        arrest with electronic monitoring, continuous alcohol monitoring, or
        both types of monitoring shall not exceed six months. The five
        consecutive days in jail do not have to be served prior to or
        consecutively to the period of house arrest.

        As an alternative to the mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days
        required by subsection (h)(1)B.2. of this section, the court, under this
        subsection, may sentence the offender to ten consecutive days in jail
        and not less than thirty-six consecutive days of house arrest with
        electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
        electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The cumulative
        total of the ten consecutive days in jail and the period of house arrest
        with electronic monitoring, continuous alcohol monitoring or both types
        of monitoring shall not exceed six months. The ten consecutive days in
        jail do not have to be served prior to or consecutively to the period of
