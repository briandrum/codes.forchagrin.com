lines if approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Architectural Board

requirements at side and rear lot lines joining nonresidential uses in order to
permit shared drive and parking facilities. Such action shall be taken only if
it is determined that site design or safety will be improved as a result. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall require the submission of written
reciprocal agreements between the property owners, which shall be recorded with
the County Recorder, guaranteeing the observance of all required conditions for
the life of the shared driving and/or parking facilities, which agreement shall
be reviewed and subject to the approval of the Law Director, which agreements
shall name the Municipality as a third party beneficiary of the agreements with
the right to enforce such reciprocal agreements.

project no more than six feet into a required rear yard.
