## 1141.01   Intent

Off-street parking and loading requirements and regulations are established in
order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:

1. _(a)_ To prevent and relieve congestion on streets;
2. _(b)_ To promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians by locating
parking areas so as to lessen car movements in areas of congestion; and
3. _(c)_ To promote the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of
institutional, residential, retail business and industrial developments which
depend upon off-street parking and off-street loading facilities.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1141.02   Off-street parking facilities; when required

Accessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways, shall
be determined in conformance with the schedule in Section 1141.05 for the various office, institutional, residential, retail business,
industrial buildings and uses, and provided in conformance with the other
provisions of this chapter as a condition precedent to the occupancy of such
building or use.

1. _(a)_ Central Shopping District.
    1. _(1)_ A change of one permitted use to another permitted use occupying
the existing floor area of a building shall not require parking greater than
that already provided for or allowed as a lawful non-conforming use for the
previous permitted use of such building.
    2. _(2)_ Parking facilities shall be provided for any additional parking
requirement resulting from an increase in the number of dwelling units, indoor
or outdoor seating capacity, floor area or number of establishments. For
purposes of this section "establishment" shall be considered a use or uses
occupying a space which is defined by exclusive access and walls separating
such use or uses from all other uses.
    3. _(3)_ Parking facilities shall be provided for the entire building
whenever a new building is constructed.
2. _(b)_ All Other Districts.
    1. _(1)_ Parking facilities shall be provided for the entire building or use
whenever a building is constructed or a new use established,
    2. _(2)_ Parking facilities shall be provided for the entire building or use
whenever the use of an existing building is changed to a use requiring more
parking facilities
    3. _(3)_ Parking facilities shall be provided for the entire building or use
wherever an existing building is altered so that there is an increase in the
number of dwelling units, seating capacity, floor area or number of
establishments. For purposes of this section "establishment" shall be
considered a use or uses occupying a space which is defined by exclusive access
and walls separating such use or uses from all other uses.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1141.03   Continuation of parking facilities

1. _(a)_ All off-street parking facilities, or those required as accessory to a
use of a proposed or altered building, shall continue unobstructed in
operation, shall not be used for automobile service or repair and shall not be
reduced below the required size as long as the main use remains, unless an
equivalent number of spaces is provided for such use in another approved
location in accordance with this Planning and Zoning Code.
2. _(b)_ In order to insure the continued use for automobile parking purposes
of any areas established therefor, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
require, before approval of same, evidence in writing that the owner or owners
of the land to be included in such automobile parking areas have by covenant
agreed to continue the use of such land for off-street parking accessory to the
residential, institutional, business or industrial use for which such parking
areas are required, such covenant first be reviewed and approved by the Law
Director, to be filed among the records of Cuyahoga County, and enforceable by
the Municipality.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1141.04   Standards and definitions

For the purpose of determining accessory off-street parking requirements,
definitions and standards shall be as follows:

1. _(a)_ "Accessory off-street parking space" means an open or enclosed area
that is not located in a dedicated right of way and that is accessible from a
street or alley for parking of motor vehicles of owners, occupants, employees,
customers or tenants of the main building or use. Except for one and two-family
dwellings, each space shall be not less than nine feet wide and 180 square feet
in area. Unless otherwise permitted to use a drive for parking, such required
parking spaces shall be exclusive of all drives, curbs and turning space. The
number of spaces shall be determined from an accurate plan of the area and the
regulations found in Sections
1141.04,
1141.05 and
1141.06.
2. _(b)_ "Floor area" means the total area of all the floors measured from the
exterior faces of the building. Where building floor area is designated as the
standard for determining parking space requirements, floor area shall be the
total of all floor areas of the building, excluding stairwells and elevator
shafts, mechanical equipment rooms and utility rooms; provided however, that
such exclusions shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total floor area.
3. _(c)_ "Seat" means the number of seating units installed or indicated, or
each twenty- four linear inches of benches, pews or space for loose chairs or
similar seating facilities; spacing of rows shall be thirty inches on center.
4. _(d)_ "Employees" means the maximum number of employees on any two
successive shifts.
5. _(e)_ Required Minimum Parking Spaces. Where the computation results in a
fractional unit, one additional off-street parking space shall be provided.
6. _(f)_ Parking facilities serving any dwelling shall be located on the same
lot as the dwelling served.
7. _(g)_ No vehicle shall be parked so that any portion extends over any lot
line or public sidewalk.
8. _(h)_ No off-street parking space shall be located so that any portion
extends over any lot line, public sidewalk or public right of way.

Other Buildings or
Uses
For a specific building or use not scheduled above, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall apply the unit of measurement of the above schedule deemed to
be most similar to the parking required by the proposed building or use. If the
Planning and Zoning Commission determines that there is no listed use similar
to the proposed use, the Planning and Zoning Commission may refer to the
estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the American Planning
Association (APA), the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and/or the Institute of
Traffic Engineers (ITE).  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1141.06   Modifications to schedule

An existing building or use which does not conform to parking requirements as
set forth in Section 1141.05 and where land is not available on the same lot or
adjoining lot, the Planning and Zoning Commission may modify the location of
parking facilities to permit such facilities within 400 feet walking distance of
any customer entrance to the building or use. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall permit such facilities only if it determines that the pedestrian route
between the parking area and the subject use is safe and does not necessitate
unlawful trespassing, and continuous parking is available pursuant to covenants
in compliance with Section 1141.03  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1141.07   Separate or combined use of facilities

1. _(a)_ A building containing one use shall provide the off-street parking
spaces as required for the specific use.
2. _(b)_ A building, or group of buildings, containing two or more uses,
operating normally during the same hours, and which have different off-street
parking requirements shall provide spaces for not less than the sum of the
spaces required for each use.
3. _(c)_ Institutions (as set forth in the schedule in Section 1141.05) may assume that up to, but not more than fifty percent (50%) of their
requirements may be shared in contiguous parking areas which are accessory to
business establishments and which normally have different hours of operation.
Provided however, where there is a sharing of facilities by different owners,
there shall be covenants in compliance with Section 1141.03 covering a period of time as may be required by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and provided, further, that should any of the uses be changed or the
facilities discontinued, then the required spaces for the use remaining shall
be provided elsewhere as a condition precedent to the continued use of such
building or buildings.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1141.08   Pedestrian and motor vehicle safety

To help insure the safety and convenience of motorists, pedestrians and shoppers
within off-street parking and loading areas, the Planning Commission may require
additional pedestrian and motor vehicle safety features within such parking and
loading areas. Safety features which the Planning Commission may require to be
installed include, but are not limited to:

1. _(a)_ Raised pedestrian walkways.
2. _(b)_ Crosswalks.
3. _(c)_ Stop signs.
4. _(d)_ Motor vehicle directional arrows.
5. _(e)_ Continuous landscaped strips for pedestrian only traffic.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1141.09   Access drives to parking areas

The following standards shall apply to all off-street parking spaces, except
those required for one- and two-family dwellings:

1. _(a)_ Off-street parking spaces shall have access to a public street or
alley in such a manner that any vehicle leaving or entering the parking area
into or from a public street or alley shall be traveling in a forward motion.
2. _(b)_ The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to parking
facilities shall be planned to interfere as little as possible with the use of
nearby property and with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the nearest
streets.
3. _(c)_ The centerline of the access driveways shall be at least fifty feet
from the right-of- way line of the nearest intersecting street and spaced at
not less than 120-foot intervals measured from the centerline of the driveways.
4. _(d)_ Parking areas of more than ten spaces shall be served by a driveway or
driveways with a total of at least one entrance lane and a separate exit lane.  
Entrances and exits shall be limited to three lanes. The width of such
entrances and exits, measured at the setback line, shall conform to the
following schedule:

            Width Measured in Feet
            Minimum Maximum
One lane    10      12
Two lanes   20      24
Three lanes 30      36

In all cases the radius of the edge of the apron shall be at least fifteen
feet so that a car entering from the curb lane shall be perpendicular to the
setback line at the driveway without obstructing vehicles in other traffic
lanes.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1141.10   Off-street loading facilities

Off-street loading facilities shall be provided for all non-residential
buildings hereafter erected or altered for such uses. The facilities shall be

not be used for repair or servicing of motor vehicles. Space required and
allocated for off-street parking shall not be allocated or used to satisfy the
space requirements for off-street loading, and off-street loading spaces shall
not be allocated or used to satisfy the space requirements for off-street
parking.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1141.11   Location of loading spaces

All required loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use served
and arranged so that a public street or sidewalk will not be occupied during the
loading or unloading process. Such spaces may be open or enclosed. They shall
not be located in any setback or less than fifty feet from a residential
district.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
 

## 1141.12   Size of loading space

1. _(a)_ A required off-street loading space shall be at least twelve feet
wide by at least twenty-five feet in length for buildings less than 15,000
square feet of gross floor area, and each required loading space for a building
of 15,000 square feet or more of floor area shall be not less than twelve feet
wide by fifty feet in length. Each space shall have a vertical clearance of at
least fourteen feet. The required areas shall be exclusive of aisle and
maneuvering space.

1. _(a)_ All parking areas and loading areas and access driveways shall be
fully improved with an asphalt, concrete or other hard surface materials
approved by the Municipal Engineer. Parking areas shall be graded to provide
for drainage so that injury will not be caused to adjacent properties nor will
water drain across any private or public sidewalk. Appropriate bumper guards or
curbs shall be provided in parking areas for three or more spaces in order to
define parking spaces or limits of paved areas and to prevent vehicles from
projecting into setbacks.
