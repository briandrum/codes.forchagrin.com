1. _(a)_ To regulate the location, height and overall general characteristics of
fencing, walls, hedges, or any combination thereof within the front, side or
rear yards of any property within the Municipality;

2. _(b)_ To maintain an orderly appearance and reduce any negative impact upon
other properties where such fencing, walls, or hedges are visible.

3. _(c)_ To prohibit fence, wall or hedge placement at heights or locations
which interfere with clear visibility of vehicular and pedestrian traffic on
adjacent streets, alleys, or sidewalks.

4. _(d)_ To preserve and protect public health, safety and welfare by regulating
retaining walls and minimizing their impact on contiguous property.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

a continuous, dense planting of shrubs which have several small stems from the
ground or small branches near the ground.

3. _(c)_ "Retaining wall" means a solid barrier which is constructed of stone or
