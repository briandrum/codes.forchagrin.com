## 1142.01   Intent

It is the intent of these regulations to achieve, among others, the following
purposes.

1. _(a)_ To ensure that the open areas on developed lots are attractively
landscaped and maintained.

2. _(b)_ To ensure that residential areas are adequately screened and buffered
from adjoining nonresidential developments.

3. _(c)_ To preserve attractive visual landscapes along public streets.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1142.02   Applicability

The regulations of this chapter shall apply to all zoning districts except R1
and R2F Districts, which are regulated by provisions of Chapter 1125 and 1126.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1142.03   General landscaping

Any portion of a developed lot not used for permitted main and accessory
buildings or structures shall be landscaped with vegetative ground cover, shrubs
and trees in accordance with an overall landscaping plan acceptable to the
Municipality. Such landscaping shall be maintained in good condition. In the
development of property, existing trees and significant vegetation shall be
retained wherever feasible.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1142.04   Street trees

1. _(a)_ **General.** A grass-covered strip of land at least seven feet in width
shall be provided and maintained contiguous to each property in a location
between the sidewalk (where one exists or is proposed), and the curb or pavement
edge of a contiguous public street. Such area shall be planted with trees spaced
at intervals of not more than thirty-five feet on centers at an initial diameter
of three inches at twelve inches above ground level.

2. _(b)_ **Tree Types.** All tree varieties shall be from a list of approved
trees kept on file in the Building Department.

3. _(c)_ **Private Streets.** The requirement for tree plantings shall also
apply to private streets in Attached Single Family, Multi-Family, Retirement
Living, Residential Mixed Use and Cluster Residential Districts. However, such
trees may be spaced at intervals greater than thirty-five feet, as approved by
the Administrator, in order to encourage the clustering of trees.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1142.05   Parking areas

1. _(a)_ **Perimeter Planting.** A continuous landscaped strip of evergreen
shrubs planted at intervals of not more than five feet on centers and at initial
height of at least two feet shall be provided and maintained along any side of a
parking area which is located in a setback abutting a public street. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may permit alternative forms of planting if it
determines that the required planting is either infeasible or not in keeping
with an area's character.

2. _(b)_ **Interior Landscaping.** Any single parking area with fifty or more
spaces shall utilize at least five percent (5%) of its area for landscaping
designed to interrupt the expanse of paved surface. In Attached Single Family,
Multi-Family, Residential Mixed Use, and Retirement Living Residential
Districts, landscaped islands shall be provided so that no row of parking
exceeds eight spaces in length.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1142.06   Perimeter screens

A planted area designed to screen views and noise shall be provided along
certain lot lines separating uses which are not fully compatible. The location
and nature of such perimeter screens shall be in accordance with the following
regulations.

1. _(a)_ **Location of Screen.** A perimeter planted screen shall be provided
along the following lot lines:

    1. _(1)_ On the property of a Retail or other Business, Office, or
    Industrial District use that abuts a Residential, Park or Institutional
    District use.

    2. _(2)_ On the property of a Multi-Family Residential, Attached Single-
    Family, Residential Mixed Use or Retirement Living District use that abuts a
    R1 or R2F District use.

    3. _(3)_ Along the rear lot line of an Industrial District abutting a public
    street.

2. _(b)_ **Nature of Screen.** The planted area shall provide a continuous
visual screen to an initial height of at least eight feet. The screening effect
shall be achieved in a manner deemed appropriate by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. One appropriate method involves the planting of evergreen trees at
intervals of not more than ten feet on centers and at an initial height of at
least eight feet. Another appropriate method involves the planting of evergreen
shrubs at intervals of not more than five feet on centers used either along, if
sufficient in height, or as a supplement to a row of deciduous trees. Other
acceptable approaches include the use of landscaped earth mounds topped by
shrubbery.

3. _(c)_ **Exceptions.** The screening requirement shall not apply where natural
or man-made barriers exist which will provide permanent screening generally
equivalent to that required.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1142.07   Utility uses

Maintenance facilities, sanitation facilities, storage facilities and utility
uses including but not limited to electrical substations, telephone exchanges,
communication related boxes and telephone terminal boxes located in any district
except Industrial Districts shall be governed by the following landscaping and
fencing regulations.

1. _(a)_ **Landscaping.** Utility uses shall be substantially screened from view
by evergreen shrubbery and/or trees, as approved by the Administrator. Such
landscaping shall not be required along a lot line bordering an Industrial
District.

2. _(b)_ **Fencing.** Utility uses shall be completely enclosed by a fence or
wall not less than five feet and not more than seven feet in height. The design
and construction of such fences shall be approved by the Architectural Board of
Review in consideration of factors of safety and visual impact on nearby uses.
For uses which do not present safety hazards, the Administrator may waive the
fencing requirement.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1142.08   Visibility at intersections

In all zoning districts, within a triangle formed by lines drawn between points
on two street right-of-way lines twenty-five feet from their point of
intersection, substantially unobstructed sight lines shall be maintained within
a vertical height band two and one-half to six feet above curb level.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1142.09   Maintenance of landscaping and replacement of landscaping

All landscaping required by this Chapter 1142 shall be maintained in good
condition and, when necessary, shall be replaced with landscaping comparable to
the landscaping required by the approved landscape plan in accordance with the
following:

1. _(a)_ Any tree, shrub, or bush, due to its condition, shall be replaced, at a
minimum, with a tree, shrub, or bush that is comparable to the type and height
of the tree, shrub, or bush specified for initial planting in the approved
landscape plan.

2. _(b)_ Any request to plant or maintain landscaping that is not comparable to
the landscaping required by the approved landscape plan shall be reviewed by the
Administrator and approved only if such landscaping is an improvement and
enhancement, as determined by the Administrator, to the originally approved
plan.

3. _(c)_ The Administrator, in considering whether or not landscaping is an
improvement and enhancement, shall consider the intent of Chapter 1142, the need
for a visual barrier, the intent of the original landscaping plan, the adjacent
properties, the current site conditions, including soil conditions and the
success of a certain species growing in the area, and any other factor deemed
relevant by the Administrator.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
