dangerous or vicious dog shall suffer or permit such animal to go unconfined on
the premises of such person.
2. _(b)_ No person owning, harboring or having the care or control of a
dangerous or vicious dog shall suffer or permit such dog to go beyond the
premises of such person unless such dog is securely leashed on a chain no more
than three (3) feet in length with at least 300 pounds of tensile strength and
such dog is muzzled.
3. _(c)_ No person owning, harboring or having the care or control of a
dangerous or vicious dog shall fail to post a sign conspicuously on the
property visible to any person approaching the property from the street that
states that a dangerous dog or vicious dog is present on the premises.
4. _(d)_ A dangerous or vicious dog is "unconfined" as the term is used in this
section if such dog is not confined on the premises of the person described in
subsection (a) hereof as follows:
    1. _(1)_ If the dog is outside, it must be in a securely enclosed pen or dog
run area which has secure sides and a secure top attached to all sides, and
which has a secure floor or bottom attached to all sides of the pen or which is
embedded in the ground no less than two (2) feet. Such pen or dog run area
shall be locked with a key or combination lock at all times when the animal is
within the structure.
    2. _(2)_ If the dog is inside, it may not be kept in a house or structure
when the windows are open or when screen windows or screen doors are the only
obstacle preventing the animal from exiting the structure. A dangerous or
vicious dog may not be kept on a patio, porch or in any part of a house or
structure which would allow the animal to exit the building on its own
volition, whether or not such dog is on a chain or leash.
5. _(e)_ No person shall keep, own, harbor, care for, or control a vicious dog
within the Village until such dog has been registered with the Chief of Police
of the Village and a permit is obtained. Such dogs shall be registered with the
Village within ten (10) days of the date the dog is first brought into the
Village, and thereafter on an annual basis on or before the 31st day of January
of each calendar year. The permit fee shall be twenty dollars ($20.00) per
year. No person shall keep, own, harbor, care for or control more than one
vicious dog in any dwelling unit in the Village at any one time. No person
shall keep, own, harbor, care for or control any vicious dog on any premises in
the Village at any time unless such person is the owner of said premises or
unless such person has the written permission of the owner of said premises to
keep, own, harbor, care for or control such vicious dog on said premises.
6. _(f)_ Any person keeping, owning, harboring or having the care or control of
any vicious dog shall maintain a policy of liability insurance providing
coverage for each occurrence in an amount not less than one million dollars
($1,000,000) and insuring such person against any claim, loss, damage or injury
to persons, domestic animals or property resulting from the acts, whether
intentional or unintentional, of the vicious dog. Such person shall produce
evidence of such policy of insurance at the time of the initial registration
and annual renewal of registration of the vicious dog with the Chief of Police
of the Village and at any time upon request of a law enforcement agent or other
employee of the Village. The Village shall be named as a certificate holder on
all such policies.
7. _(g)_ Impoundment of Dogs.
    1. _(1)_ Any vicious dog being harbored or cared for within the Village that
is not registered with the Chief of Police as provided in subsection (e)
hereinabove may be seized and impounded by the Chief of Police or his agent or
other law enforcement officer, to a kennel chosen by the Chief of Police or his
agent, until such time as the dog is properly registered and a permit obtained.

enforcement officer seizes such an unregistered vicious dog, notice shall be
given the presumed owner within two (2) business days after the seizure by
personal service or by posting a written notice upon the premises at which the
dog was being harbored or kept. The dog shall not be released until the owner
registers the dog and pays all accumulated boarding charges. In the event the

(5) business days of the delivery of the notice of impoundment, such dog shall
be deemed abandoned and may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the
Village.
    2. _(2)_ In the event a law enforcement officer has probable cause to
believe a dog has attacked a human being or other domestic animal in the
Village, the law enforcement officer may impound such dog pending trial. In the
event the Court finds that such dog attacked a human being or other domestic
animal, in addition to any penalty imposed by the Court, the dog shall not be
released to the owner until all accumulated boarding and impound charges are
paid; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Court from
ordering the dog destroyed or banished as provided in subsection (j) herein
below, in which case the owner shall still be responsible for boarding charges.
If the dog is not ordered destroyed or banished, the owner shall reclaim such
dog and pay all accumulated boarding and impound charges within five (5)
business days after sentencing, otherwise the dog shall be deemed abandoned and
may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the Village.
    3. _(3)_ In the event a law enforcement officer has probable cause to
believe that a registered vicious dog is being harbored or cared for in
violation of this Section, and such animal has not attacked a human being or
other domestic animal, the law enforcement officer may petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to order the seizure and impoundment of the vicious dog
pending trial, with the boarding charges to be paid by the owner.
    4. _(4)_ Upon the resultant death or serious injury of a domestic animal or
a human being, the Police Department shall have the authority, but not the
duty, in the interest of public safety, to seize the dog that caused the death
or serious injury and impound it in a kennel determined by the Chief of Police
or his agent. Any person keeping or harboring a dog sought to be impounded
shall give possession of such dog to a Police Officer upon demand.
    5. _(5)_ If a dangerous or vicious dog aggressively bites any person or
domestic animal, the Police Department shall have the authority, but not the
duty, in the interest of public safety, to seize the offending dog and impound
it at a kennel determined by the Chief of Police or its agent. A person keeping
or harboring a dog sought to be impounded shall give possession of such dog to
a Police Officer upon demand.

any and all costs associated with the housing of the dog.
    7. _(7)_ A dog impounded pursuant to subsection (g)(5) hereof, shall remain
impounded until the court makes a final determination as to whether a violation
of this chapter has occurred or until the owner or keeper provides satisfactory
proof to the Chief of Police that they have complied with all applicable
provisions of this chapter and renders payment for the costs of housing the
dog. Upon final determination, by the court, the owner or keeper of an
impounded dog shall claim it within fourteen (14) calendar days by rendering
proof to the Chief of Police that they have complied with all applicable
provisions of this chapter and have paid for the costs of housing the dog. If
the dog is not claimed pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Village may
dispose of the dog at its discretion.
8. _(h)_ Whoever violates any provision of this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the second degree for a first violation and shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree for each such subsequent violation within three
(3) years of the first violation.
9. _(i)_ For purposes of subsections (a) and (b) hereof, testimony that a
dangerous or vicious dog was unconfined on the premises of its owner, harborer,
or person having the care or control of such dangerous or vicious dog, or that
a dangerous or vicious dog was beyond the premises of its owner, harborer, or
person having the care or control of such dangerous or vicious dog and was not
securely leashed and muzzled according to the provisions of subsection (b)
hereof, shall be prima-facie evidence that such owner, harborer, or person
having the care or control of a dangerous or vicious dog suffered or permitted
such dog to go unconfined on the premises of such person or suffered or
permitted such dangerous or vicious dog to go beyond the premises of such
person when not securely leashed and muzzled as described in subsection (b)
hereof. For purposes of subsections (a), (b), (d) and (e) hereof, strict
criminal liability is contemplated.
10. _(j)_ Any dangerous or vicious dog which attacks a human being or another
domestic animal may be ordered to be destroyed or to be permanently banished
from the Village when, in the judgment of the Bedford Municipal Court, such
dangerous or vicious dog represents a continuing threat of serious harm to
human beings or other domestic animals.
11. _(k)_ In prosecutions for a violation of division (a) or (e) hereof in
connection with which a dog has caused injury or serious injury to or the death
of a person or domestic animal, any of the following may be asserted as an
affirmative defense as applicable:
    1. _(1)_ The dog was teased, tormented or abused by a person.
    2. _(2)_ The dog was coming to the aid or defense of a person who was not
engaged in illegal or criminal activity and who was not using the dog as a
means of carrying out such activity.
    3. _(3)_ The dog caused injury or serious injury to a person or killed a
person while the person was committing or attempting to commit a trespass or
other criminal offense on the property of the owner, keeper, or harborer of the
dog.
    4. _(4)_ In the case of another domestic animal, that the dog was attacked
by such animal or that such animal was running at large.  
(Ord. 2020-36. Passed 10-12-20; Ord. 2020-46. Passed 11-9-20.)

## 505.19   Impoundment of dogs involved in biting/attacking incidents

1. _(a)_ The Chief of Police may, but is not required to take up and impound
any dog which is alleged to have bitten or attacked a human being or other
domestic animal in violation of this chapter, pending the completion of
criminal proceedings arising from such incident. Such dog shall be boarded and
housed in an animal shelter, animal hospital, kennel or other place which the
Chief of Police deems equally secure until such time as the owner, harborer, or
other person having custody or control of such dog shall be tried or enter a
guilty or no contest plea to any and all charges arising out of the biting/
attack incident, and until such further time as the Court enters sentence,
unless otherwise ordered by the Court. The Chief of Police may permit the
owner, harborer or person having custody or control of the dog to place the dog
in a ten (10) day quarantine in a kennel they select, with the Chief of
Police’s consent as to the kennel placement and so long as the kennel provides
the Chief of Police with a certificate they kept the dog quarantined for ten
consecutive days.
2. _(b)_ Any dog impounded shall be released at the earlier of the following
times, unless a longer period of impoundment is authorized or permitted by this
chapter:
    1. _(1)_ At least ten working days have passed since the biting or attack
incident and no charges are pending against the owner, harborer or person
caring for or in control of such dog;
    2. _(2)_ The owner, harborer or person caring for or in control of the dog
has been acquitted of all criminal charges arising out of the attack/biting
incident.
3. _(c)_ Any person aggrieved by an order of the Chief of Police pursuant to
subsection (a) herein may appeal such order to the Bedford Municipal Court as
established in Section 505.23. Any such appeal should be heard within five (5) working days of the
date the notice of appeal is filed, subject to the court’s schedule or matters
that take priority by law or court policy. Notice of such hearing shall be
given to the person(s) who has allegedly been bitten or attacked by the dog,
the parent(s) or guardian(s) of any minor(s) who has allegedly been the victim
of such an attack, and the owner(s) of any domestic animal(s) which has
allegedly been bitten or attacked by the dog.
4. _(d)_ The costs of the boarding and lodging of the dog shall be charged to
the owner, harborer, and/or person caring for or in control of the dog, unless
the dog has been released pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) hereof.
5. _(e)_ The provisions of this Section shall be in addition to any other
procedures, penalties and/or remedies provided in this chapter or otherwise
available at law.  
(Ord. 2020-36. Passed 10-12-20.)

## 505.20   Dangerous and vicious dog impounding procedure; redemption or disposition

1. _(a)_ In addition to other procedures and penalties applicable to violations
of this chapter, the Chief of Police may take up and impound any animal found
in violation hereof, who has not been designated as dangerous or vicious yet.
If such animal is not wearing a valid license tag, the Chief of Police may,
within three (3) days after taking up such animal, turn such animal over to an
officer charged by law with the custody and disposal of such animals. If the
animal is wearing a license tag or some other type of identification showing
the name and address of its owner, the Chief of Police shall immediately give
such person notice that the animal has been found and taken up. The animal
shall not be released to its owner except upon payment to the Village of all
lawful costs assessed against the animal to cover the cost of taking it up,
plus such additional costs as may be incurred by the Village for impounding the
animal.  
Such release payment shall be tendered within five (5) days of receipt of
notice by the animal’s owner; however, no period of holding by the Village
shall exceed seven (7) days unless the seventh (7th) days falls on a weekend.
Any animal not reclaimed within the respective time periods may be destroyed or
otherwise disposed of at the discretion of the Chief of Police. "Otherwise
disposed of" shall include the right to sell these animals to suitable
individuals for the cost to the Village of the animal’s boarding. When such a
sale does occur, the Village shall not charge the buyer with the impounding
fee. No sale will be transacted until a valid registration tag, if required, is
obtained.
2. _(b)_ The Village may assess against or charge the owner, keeper or harborer
of any domestic animal the actual costs relative to the seizure and/or
impoundment of such animal for its seizure, shelter, food, and any veterinary
care found necessary during impoundment. Such costs may include the cost to
have the animal spayed or neutered and vaccinated.
3. _(c)_ The Chief of Police’s Office may keep a register of people interested
in obtaining an animal impounded by the Village. Such register may be
categorized by the breed desired and should be set up to give the person who
has been registered the longest period of time the first chance to obtain the
animal.  
(Ord. 2020-36. Passed 10-12-20.)

## 505.21   Court order to remove or destroy animal

In addition to any penalty provided herein, if the court determines that any
animal, on one or more occasions, has bitten or attacked any person or domestic
animal without provocation, or if the court determines that the owner of the
animal has habitually permitted such animal to run at large, or violated this
chapter on one or more occasions, the court may, in order to protect the
health, welfare, safety and property of the Village’s inhabitants, order that
such animal be destroyed or permanently banished from the Village.  
(Ord. 2020-36. Passed 10-12-20.)

## 505.22   Designation of dog as "dangerous” and "vicious"

1. _(a)_ A dog may be determined to be "dangerous" or "vicious", as defined in
Section 505.17 and subject to the requirements of Section 505.18 in one of the two (2) following ways:
    1. _(1)_ A court of competent jurisdiction may declare the dog to be vicious
or dangerous in an independent or related civil or criminal proceeding; or
    2. _(2)_ The Chief of Police may provide written notice to the owner or
other person harboring or having care or control of the dog that the Chief of
Police has determined the dog to be dangerous or vicious. Such notice shall be
given by personal service, ordinary mail, or by posting on the property at
which the person resides.
2. _(b)_ Any dog declared to be vicious by the Chief of Police is a final order
and appealable to the Bedford Municipal Court.  
(Ord. 2020-36. Passed 10-12-20.)

## 505.23   Dangerous and vicious dog appeal

1. _(a)_ Any owner of a dog adversely affected by the order of the Chief of
Police or any other member of the Police Department or any agent of the Chief
of Police pursuant to this chapter may appeal such order in writing by filing a
notice of appeal with the Bedford Municipal Court, and a copy shall be served
on the Village Police Department. Such appeal shall be filed within ten (10)
working days of the date of notice received from the Chief of Police in Section 505.22. The filing of a notice of appeal with the Bedford Municipal Court shall
stay the requirements of Section 505.18, but shall not preclude the Chief of Police or the Cuyahoga County Board
of Health from impounding the dog if otherwise permitted by this chapter or
other provisions of law and shall not in any way relieve the owner or other
person harboring or having care or control of the dog from civil or criminal
liability for injury or damage caused by the dog or for violations of
provisions of this chapter other than Section 505.18.  
(Ord. 2020-36. Passed 10-12-20; Ord. 2020-46. Passed 11-9-20.)
