## 149.01   Within-range pay adjustments

Salary adjustments within an established range shall not be automatic, but shall
be dependent upon formal recommendation of the Director and discretion of the
Mayor. Any employee whose job performance is satisfactory may be advanced within
the series of steps in his or her assigned pay range as follows:

1. _(a)_ From Step A through advancement of Step E, employees in all ranges may
be advanced to the next higher step after one year of satisfactory service at
each step. The decision to award or withhold a step increase shall be based on
performance. The employee shall be informed of the reasons for withholding a
step increase and the improvement in performance required to obtain a
satisfactory rating.

2. _(b)_ Where an employee has received a performance evaluation indicating
outstanding performance, a merit step advance over and above the step for
satisfactory service may be given for such outstanding performance. A merit step
advance which has been granted for outstanding performance over and above the
step advance for satisfactory service shall be effective for a twelve-month
period, and such employee's pay shall be treated in accordance with such
employee's performance evaluation done at the end of such twelve-month period.

3. _(c)_ General increases or decreases resulting from the adjustment of the
basic compensation schedules shall not prevent within-range pay increases in
accordance with this section.\

    hours beginning at the same time each calendar day. Changes in an employee's
    starting time or work shift may be made at any time to meet the needs of the
    Village. Generally, however, when such changes are made for a short period
    of time (generally less than two days) with the expectation that the
    employee will return to his original starting time of his work shift, his
    regular starting time of his work shift should not be changed.

    2. _(2)_ **Hours Worked for Overtime Calculation.** For purposes of
    calculating all employee overtime in this [Section 149.06][CFCO 149.06],
    paid holiday time, paid vacation time, and paid sick leave shall be counted

5. _(e)_ **Call-In Pay.** Regular full-time Public Service and Finance
Department employees who are called in outside of their regular schedule of
hours shall be paid at the applicable premium rate, but not less than the
equivalent of four hours pay at their straight time rate. This does not apply
when an employee continues to work after his normal work shift schedule ends or
is told to report prior to his regular scheduled starting time. This premium
payment shall be limited to one occurrence in an employee's work day. This
subsection shall also apply to temporary full-time laborers when authorized and
approved by the department head.

6. _(f)_ **Compensation.** All overtime which is not paid with regular
compensation under provisions of the salary ordinance shall not be accumulated
and no employee shall be entitled to compensation in any form for such overtime
upon termination of his employment with the Municipality. In no department is
overtime to be duplicated or pyramided. No credit will be allowed or premium
payment made for overtime labor unless it is rendered pursuant to prior order or
approval by the department head or other supervisory employee customarily
authorized to grant such approval.\
(Ord. 1986-65. Passed 12-22-86; Ord. 1995-25. Passed 3-13-95.)

employee from the respective department head for use during a period which will
not unduly disrupt or interfere with the normal operation of that department.

Cash payment will be made to an employee for unused compensatory time only upon
the occasion of that employee's separation from service with the Village.\

| After 25                     | $1,200 |

(Ord. 1986-65. Passed 12-22-86.)

## 149.08   Jury duty and military pay

1. _(a)_ **Jury Duty.** All Village employees called to jury duty are entitled
to a leave of absence from their respective duties for such time as they are on
jury duty but not exceeding fifteen days in any calendar year. Required jury
duty beyond fifteen days shall result in the employee being on unpaid leave
status.

    If an employee's jury duty pay or compensation during such leave of absence
    is less than the employee's Village pay would have been for the same period,
    the employee will be paid by the Village the difference in money between the
    Village pay and the jury duty pay for such period.

2. _(b)_ **Military Leave.** All Village employees who are members of the Ohio
National Guard, the Ohio State Guard, the Ohio Navy Militia, or other reserve
components of the Armed Forces of the United States are entitled to a leave of
absence from the respective duties for such time as they are on military duty in
field training or active duty for periods not exceeding thirty-one days in any
calendar year.

    If an employee's military pay or compensation during such leave of absence
    is less than the employee's pay would have been for the same period, the
    employee will be paid by the Village the difference in money between the
    Village pay and military pay for such period.

3. _(c)_ In calculating an employee's jury duty pay or military pay, allowances
for travel, food or housing shall not be considered, but any other pay or
allowances of whatever nature, including longevity pay, shall be considered.\
(Ord. 1996-40. Passed 7-8-96.)

## 149.09   Committee meetings

1. _(a)_ Village employees who attend meetings during other than normal working
hours for the purpose of taking minutes shall be paid at a rate of thirty
dollars ($30.00) per meeting or at that employee's hourly rate at time and one-
half, if applicable, whichever is greater.\

Christmas Day and two personal days, such time to be requested in advance and

computed on the basis of an eight-hour day at the employee's existing rate of
compensation. Full-time employees shall use such holidays and personal days
within the year they are available or the same shall be forfeited. It shall not
be permitted to obtain cash in lieu of the holidays and personal days.

Every regular part-time employee required to work a specific number of hours on
specific days shall be entitled to receive compensation for the aforementioned
ten legal holidays if the holiday occurs on the employee's regular working day;
compensation shall be computed on the basis of the employee's regular scheduled
hours at straight time.\

        1. _(A)_ Deferred salary; and

        2. _(B)_ Cash salary.

    2. _(2)_ An eligible employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that
    percentage of that employee's total salary which is required from time to
    time by OPERS or OP&F to be paid as an employee contribution by that
    employee, and shall be paid by the Village to OPERS or OP&F on behalf of
    that employee as a pick up and in lieu of OPERS or OP&F employee
    contribution otherwise payable by that employee. Employees shall not have
    the option of receiving the statutorily required contribution directly
    instead of it being paid by the Village to OPERS or OP&F.

4. _(d)_ Such employee's cash salary shall be equal to that employee's total

subject to applicable payroll deductions to that employee.

    OPERS or OP&F based upon an employee's total salary. The total combined
    expenditures of the Village for such employee's total salaries payable under

    not be greater than the amounts the employee would have been paid for those
    items had this provision not been in effect.

    2. _(2)_ A person electing this pick up deduction shall not have the option
    of choosing to receive the payroll deduction directly instead of having this
    deduction picked up by the Village. Members who have elected to participate
    in this plan cannot increase, decrease or terminate the amount of the pick
    up deduction.

5. _(e)_ All full-time Village employees identified in subsection (b) hereof and
who are contributing members of OPERS or OP&F may purchase additional service
credit, tax deferred, and the Village shall withhold the required service credit
deduction from the gross pay of each person who elects to do so and shall pick
up (assume and pay) such deduction to OPERS or OP&F in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.

6. _(f)_ The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to perform all acts
necessary and appropriate to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of
