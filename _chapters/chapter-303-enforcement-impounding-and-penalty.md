    storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned
    junk motor vehicle, that has been left at the garage or place of storage for
    a longer period than that agreed upon. When ordering a motor vehicle into

    the power of the towing service.

    3. _(3)_ Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
    vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the
    vehicle only in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.

    4. _(4)_ As used in this section "private residential property" means
    private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as
    a home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
    three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures.
    "Private residential property" does not include any private property on
    which is located one or more structures that are used as a home, residence
    or sleeping place by two or more persons, if more than three separate
    households are maintained in the structure or structures.

2. _(b)_ If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.

    Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
    vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
    assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle
    to the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator
    immediately shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or
    private agricultural property without the permission of the person having
    the right to possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of
    storage without the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

3. _(c)_

    1. _(1)_ The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that
    the Chief orders into storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section.
    The record shall include an entry for each such motor vehicle that
    identifies the motor vehicle’s license number, make, model and color, the
    location from which it was removed, the date and time of the removal, the
    telephone number of the person from whom it may be recovered, and the
    address of the place to which it has been taken and from which it may be
    recovered. The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record
    that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in
    person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or
    operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining to its
    location.

    2. _(2)_ Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
    Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
    subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
    enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
    identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
    information pertaining to its location.

4. _(d)_

    1. _(1)_ The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into

    both of the following:

        1. _(A)_ Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
        Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the
        vehicle was towed within a municipal corporation that has established
        fees for vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees
        established by the municipal corporation.

        2. _(B)_ Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
        certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration
        for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. When the owner of a vehicle
        towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the towing service or
        storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the owner
        written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
        lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio
        R.C. 4513.611.

    2. _(2)_ Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
    subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
    ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve
    any personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
    without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
    charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
    Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves
    the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
    facility fails to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio
    R.C. 4513.69, if applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do
    either of the following:

        1. _(A)_ Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
        sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
        investigation;

        2. _(B)_ Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
        the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of
        liability. For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal
        items” do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.

    3. _(3)_ If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
    subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
    days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

5. _(e)_

    1. _(1)_ No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor vehicle
    from any private residential or private agricultural property other than in
    accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4513.61 to
    4513.65.

    2. _(2)_ No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
    requirements of this section.

of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the actual
amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. Upon its

        evidence.

    2. _(2)_ If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
    or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of
    the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by

    additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). If the court
    imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation and an
    additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the court
    shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of
    not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
    to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection
    (b)(1) of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends
    and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
    evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
    shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
    violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
