## 1357.01   Purpose and scope 

1. _(a)_ The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Chagrin Falls:
2. _(b)_ This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of Chagrin Falls to:
    1. _(1)_ Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
SCMs are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
    2. _(2)_ Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
    3. _(3)_ Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
    4. _(4)_ Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
    5. _(5)_ Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
    6. _(6)_ Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
    7. _(7)_ Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
    8. _(8)_ Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
    9. _(9)_ Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of Chagrin
Falls’ future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream
crossings.
    10. _(10)_ Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
3. _(c)_ This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section 1357.01.
4. _(d)_ Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
Village of Chagrin Falls shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
5. _(e)_ This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
6. _(f)_ This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter 1357
Comprehensive Stormwater Management.

## 1357.09   Performance standards

1. _(a)_ General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
    1. _(1)_ Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and minimizes
the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity of the
water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site. Acceptable
practices shall:
        1. _(A)_ Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended
to support a watercourse restoration project and complies with Chapter 1151 of the Chagrin Falls Planning and Zoning Code.
        2. _(B)_ Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
        3. _(C)_ Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
        4. _(D)_ Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
        5. _(E)_ Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the Village of Chagrin Falls and Ohio EPA.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the Village Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
    2. _(2)_ Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to
achieve the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be
compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine
maintenance.
    3. _(3)_ Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter 1161, shall provide stormwater management and water quality controls for the
development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
    4. _(4)_ Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section 1357.07 of this Chapter, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter 1355 of the Building Code and Chapter 1151 of the Planning and Zoning Code, all as determined by the Village
Engineer.
    5. _(5)_ Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels:  All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
    6. _(6)_ Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section 1357.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCMs, or if
the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the
Village Engineer.
    7. _(7)_ Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the Village Engineer
as detailed in Section 1357.08 of this Chapter.
    8. _(8)_ Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village of Chagrin
    Falls, SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot
    held and maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by
    the property owners, by the Village of Chagrin Falls. SCMs serving single
    lots shall be placed on these lots, protected within an easement, and
    maintained by the property owner.

    9. _(9)_ Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
    and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
    extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
    compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
    existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
    operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one
    time, and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective
    clearing and grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater
    runoff to and through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices
    shall provide perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a
    receiving stream’s physical, chemical and biological characteristics are
    protected and ecological functions are maintained.

    10. _(10)_ Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated stormwater
    runoff from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the
    runoff enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology,
    hydroperiod, and wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no
    erosion occurs down slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative
    buffers, infiltration basins, conservation of forest covers, and the
    preservation of intermittent streams, depressions, and drainage corridors
    may be used to maintain the wetland hydrology.

    If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
    analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge
    matches the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the
    wetland.

    11. _(11)_ Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the
    maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
    compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
    impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
    holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded should be
    restored to that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent
    practicable. Areas that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff
    layer removed should be amended using the following steps:

        1. _(1)_ till subsoil to a depth of 15-18 inches,
        2. _(2)_ incorporate compost through top 12 inches,
        3. _(3)_ Replace with stockpiled site or imported suitable topsoil to a
        minimum depth of 4 inches.

2. _(b)_ Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:

    1. _(1)_ Water Protection: The Village Engineer may allow modification to
    streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
    applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the
    Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and
    local agencies as required in Section 1357.07  of this Chapter, and the
    activity is in compliance with Chapter 1355   of the Building Code and
    Chapter 1151  of the Planning and Zoning Code, all as determined by the
    Village Engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the
    project will minimize changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form,
    channel form, and habitat of upstream and downstream channels on and off the
    property.

    2. _(2)_ Off-site Stormwater Discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
    discharges to or across the applicant’s development site shall be conveyed
    through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
    its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall
    be diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
    possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat
    the off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be
    approved until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village
    Engineer that off- site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the
    development site in a manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream
    flooding and erosion.

    3. _(3)_ Sheet Flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
    sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
    shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and
    the use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit
    re-grading and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no
    case shall the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet
    flow area exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel,
    storm sewer, or other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain
    sheet flow, all as determined by the Village Engineer.

    4. _(4)_ Open Channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
    drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with
    vegetated banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff
    from upstream contributory areas.

    5. _(5)_ Open Drainage Systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
    all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
    systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
    allowed under Village of Chagrin Falls zoning or where the use of an open
    drainage system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the
    Village Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer
    systems when necessary:

        1. _(A)_ Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
        from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic
        grade line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the
        overlying roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the
        roadway during a 10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to
        meet these requirements when conveying the flows from the contributing
        drainage area within the proposed development and existing flows from
        offsite areas that are upstream from the development.
        2. _(B)_ The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
        sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private
        systems, subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
        3. _(C)_ All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
        consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource.
        The tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm
        frequency. The hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be
        computed with consideration for the energy losses associated with
        entrance into and exit from the system, friction through the system, and
        turbulence in the individual manholes, catch basins, and junctions
        within the system.
        4. _(D)_ The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and
        other structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the
        incidence of quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
        5. _(E)_ Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or
        outlets to and from open channels or lakes.
    6. _(6)_ Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
    design structures that cross a water resource in the Village of Chagrin
    Falls:
        1. _(A)_ Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed
        to convey the stream’s flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
        2. _(B)_ Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
        technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the
        development. Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State
        Scenic Rivers, coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat,
        seasonal salmonid habitat streams, and Class III headwater streams. The
        footers or piers for these bridges and open spans shall not be
        constructed below the ordinary high water mark.
        3. _(C)_ If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-
        five (25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of
        box culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The
        conduit or conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under
        these conditions.
        4. _(D)_ The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
        shall be 12 inches.
        5. _(E)_ The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
        fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions.
        Erosion protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to
        properly control entrance and outlet velocities.
        6. _(F)_ All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
        for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
        tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
        7. _(G)_ Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
        and from open channels or lakes.
        8. _(H)_ Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
        incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict
        head loss differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the
        100-year storm event.
        9. _(I)_ Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile
        through a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for
        either the 100 year, 24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as
        determined by FEMA, whichever is more restrictive.
    7. _(7)_ Overland Flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
    convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an
    adequate receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained
    within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause
    flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface
    elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the
    finished grade elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing
    paths, the conveyance capacity of the site’s storm sewers shall be taken
    into consideration.
    8. _(8)_ Compensatory Flood Storage Mitigation: In order to preserve
    floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
    elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village of
    Chagrin Falls must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume.
    First consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes
    should be given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access
    to the new floodplain within the limits of the development site.
    Consideration will also be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention
    basins to compensate for floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic
    analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the
    Village of Chagrin Falls, reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must
    be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development. Embankment
    slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to the
    natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical retaining
    structures is specifically prohibited.
    9. _(9)_ Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
    at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
    erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
    natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
    resource are maintained and protected.
3. _(c)_ Stormwater Quality Control:
    1. _(1)_ Direct runoff to an SCM: The site shall be designed to direct
    runoff to one or more of the following SCMs. These practices are listed in
    Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following
    general performance standards:
        1. _(A)_ Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
        filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to
        a water resource.
        2. _(B)_ Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote
        settling, filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate
        captured stormwater into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a
        soil engineering report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate that
        any proposed infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
        For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a
        comprehensive stormwater management plan, the Village Engineer may
        approve other SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the Village
        Engineer’s satisfaction that these SCMs meet the objectives of this
        regulation as stated in Section 1357.09(c)(6) of this Chapter.
        3. _(C)_ For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
        acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
        disturb five (5) or more acres, the Village Engineer may approve other
        SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the [community engineer’s]
        satisfaction that these SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation as
        stated in Section 1357.09(c)(6) of this Chapter, and has prior written
        approval from the Ohio EPA.
        4. _(D)_ For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
        projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships,
        cities, or villages), the Village Engineer may approve SCMs not included
        in Table 2 of this regulation, but must show compliance with the current
        version of the Ohio Department of Transportation "Location and Design
        Manual, Volume Two Drainage Design".
    2. _(2)_ Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
    the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water
    Quality Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
        1. _(A)_ The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
        rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
        methods:
            1. _(1)_ Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
            Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific
            hydrologic parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration
            characteristics, slope, and surface routing characteristics;
            proposed SCMs controlling the amount and/or timing of runoff from
            the site; and local long-term hourly records, or
            2. _(2)_ Using the following equation: WQV = C*P*A/12

            where terms have the following meanings:

            * WQV = water quality volume in acre-feet
            * C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 in.
            * P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
            * A = area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.

            Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection
            Agency (Ohio EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined
            using the list in Table 1 or using the following equation to
            calculate the runoff coefficient:

            C= 0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:

            i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious

            --------------------------------------------------|------------------
            Industrial & Commercial                           |0.8
            High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)      |0.5
            Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre)|0.4
            Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)       |0.3
            Open Space and Recreational Areas                 |0.2

            Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be
            calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the
            contributing drainage area to the stormwater treatment structure
            is Low Density Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and
            10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is calculated as
            follows: (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)

        2. _(B)_ An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
        incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage. This
        volume shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices
        where pollutants will accumulate.
        3. _(C)_ Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
        with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be
        granted by the Village Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
        4. _(D)_ Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
        that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect
        against downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage
        available for successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
        5. _(E)_ Sites within watersheds of coldwater habitat streams shall
        include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the
        temperature of discharged runoff. SCMs that reduce the temperature of
        discharged runoff include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground
        detention, and incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot
        design.
        6. _(F)_ Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
        vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities
        defined in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

        Table 2: Draw Down Times for Stormwater Control Measures

        Stormwater Control Measure                      | Drain Time of WQv
        ------------------------------------------------|------------------
        Infiltration Basin or Trench<sup>1</sup>        | 48 hours
        Permeable Pavement - Infiltration<sup>1</sup>   | 48 hours
        Permeable Pavement - Extended Detention         | 24 hours
        Extended Detention Facilities                   |         
            Dry Extended Detention Basin<sup>2</sup>    | 48 hours
            Wet Extended Detention Basin<sup>3</sup>    | 24 hours
            Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) | 24 hours
            Bioretention Area/Cell*<sup>5,6</sup>       | 24 hours
            Sand and other Media Filtration<sup>5</sup> | 24 hours
            Pocket Wetland<sup>7</sup>                  | 24 hours

        <sup>1</sup> <small>Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall
        empty within 48 hours to provide storage for subsequent storm
        events.</small>

        <sup>2</sup> <small>The use of a forebay and micropool is required on
        all dry extended detention basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10%
        of the WQv.</small>

        <sup>3</sup> <small>Provide both a permanent pool and an extended
        detention volume above the permanent pool, each sized with at least
        0.75*WQV.</small>

        <sup>4</sup> <small>Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv
        above the permanent water pool.</small>

        <sup>5</sup> <small>The surface ponding area shall completely empty
        within 24 hours so that there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown
        times are acceptable as long as design criteria in Rainwater and Land
        Development have been met.</small>

        <sup>6</sup> <small>This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was
        previously titled enhanced water quality swale.</small>

        <sup>7</sup> <small>Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the
        WQv, with 25% of the WQv in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the
        permanent pool must be equal to the WQv.</small>

    3. _(3)_ Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
        1. _(A)_ Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
        in Rainwater and Land Development.
        2. _(B)_ All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
        through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip
        to remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration
        capacity.
        3. _(C)_ During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the
        site shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site.
        No construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin
        site to avoid soil compaction.
    4. _(4)_ Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
        1. _(A)_ The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
        half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time.
        The outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism,
        maintenance, and promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
        2. _(B)_ The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
        maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1. _(1)_ Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run
            to rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2. _(2)_ The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4
            feet shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8
            feet and no more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge.
            The 8 feet wide portion of the aquatic bench closest to the
            shoreline shall have an average depth of 6 inches below the
            permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation. The
            remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below
            the permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who
            accidentally or intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth
            of dense vegetation in a manner that allows waves and mosquito
            predators to pass through the vegetation. The maximum slope of the
            aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic bench shall be
            planted with native plant species comparable to wetland vegetation
            that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of invasive
            plant species is prohibited. An invasive species is a species that
            is both non-native (or alien) to the ecosystem under consideration
            and whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or
            environmental harm, or harm to human health
            3. _(3)_ A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
            settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool
            volume shall be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume
            (WQv).
            4. _(4)_ Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
            where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary
            outlet becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to
            facilitate maintenance. The emergency drain should be designed to
            drain by gravity where possible.
    5. _(5)_ Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
    The applicant may request approval from the Village Engineer for the use of
    alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
    satisfaction of the Village Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in
    pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
    listed in Table 2. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than
    five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
    will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is
    necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
        1. _(A)_ The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
        removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology
        Acceptance Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
        2. _(B)_ The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM
        is reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be
        negligible hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the
        State. The discharge rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if
        the applicant can demonstrate one of the following conditions:
            1. _(1)_ The entire water quality volume is recharged to
            groundwater.
            2. _(2)_ The development will create less than one acre of
            impervious surface.
            3. _(3)_ The development project is a redevelopment project with an
            ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100
            percent of the project area is already impervious surface and the
            stormwater discharge is directed into an existing storm sewer
            system.
            4. _(4)_ The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
        3. _(C)_ Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the
following requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in
the development:
            1. _(1)_ The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
            2. _(2)_ Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
            3. _(3)_ The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
                1. _(a)_ Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method, or other
hydrologic method approved by the Village Engineer, the total volume (acre-
feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
drainage area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the
following standards:
                    1. _(1)_ Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
                    2. _(2)_ Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
                    3. _(3)_ Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
                    4. _(4)_ Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
                    5. _(5)_ Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http:/
/hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
                    6. _(6)_ Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
                    7. _(7)_ Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
                        1. _(i)_ Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
                        2. _(ii)_ Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil
is amended after development according to the following protocol: till the
subsoil to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spader, or rotary tillage
and incorporate compost through top 12 inches, replace topsoil to a minimum
depth of 4 inches. All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils
shall be treated as "open space in good condition."
                    8. _(8)_ Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
                        1. _(i)_ Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
                        2. _(ii)_ Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for
shallow concentrated flow from NEH-4 (Spell this out).
                    9. _(9)_ The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the Village Engineer.
                2. _(b)_ To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section 1357.09(d)(3) of this Chapter, determine the
percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the percentage,
select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table 3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The critical
Equal to or   and Less Than:                          storm will be:
Greater Than:
--            10                                      1 year
10            20                                      2 year
20            50                                      5 year
50            100                                     10 year
100           250                                     25 year
250           500                                     50 year
500           ---                                     100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
        5. _(E)_ Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
            1. _(1)_ Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv.
            2. _(2)_ When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two.
            3. _(3)_ Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
            4. _(4)_ Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section 1357.10 of this Chapter may be approved by the Village
Engineer.  
(Ord. 2016-79. Passed 12-12-16.)

## 1357.10   Alternative actions

1. _(a)_ When the Village of Chagrin Falls determines that site constraints
compromise the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used
that result in an improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater
quantity. Such alternatives shall meet the following standards:
    1. _(1)_ Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
    2. _(2)_ Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.

Any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be
removed by the Village of Chagrin Falls at the property owners’ expense.  
(Ord. 2016-79. Passed 12-12-16.)

## 1357.12   Maintenance and final inspection approval 

To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
Village Engineer:

(Ord. 2016-79. Passed 12-12-16.)

## 1357.13   On-going inspections

The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection and
Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The Village of
Chagrin Falls has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct
inspections as necessary, with prior notification of the property owner, to
verify that the SCMs are being maintained and operated in accordance with this
regulation. Upon finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair,
the Village of Chagrin Falls shall provide written notification to the
responsible party, as detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement, of
the need for maintenance. Upon notification, the responsible party shall have
five (5) working days, or other mutually agreed upon time, to makes repairs or
submit a plan with detailed action items and established timelines. Should
repairs not be made within this time, or a plan approved by the Village
Engineer for these repairs not in place, the Village of Chagrin Falls may
undertake the necessary repairs and assess the responsible party.  
(Ord. 2016-79. Passed 12-12-16.)

## 1357.14   Fees

The Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the
Village of Chagrin Falls before the review process begins. The Village
Engineer shall establish a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost
for providing these services.  
(Ord. 2016-79. Passed 12-12-16.)

## 1357.15   Bond

1. _(a)_ If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost has been deposited with the Village of Chagrin
Falls Finance Department. This bond shall be posted for the Village of Chagrin
Falls to perform the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the
development area as stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the applicant fails to comply with the
provisions of this regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned, less
Village of Chagrin Falls administrative fees as detailed in Chapter 1357 of the Building Code of the Village of Chagrin Falls Codified Ordinances,
when the following three criteria are met:
    1. _(1)_ After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three (3) years from the
time of permanent stabilization have passed.
    2. _(2)_ An As-Built Inspection of all stormwater control measures as
described in Section 1357.12 of this Chapter is approved by the Village Engineer.
    3. _(3)_ An Inspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by the Village
of Chagrin Falls and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement has been signed by
the developer, the contractor, the Village of Chagrin Falls, and the private
owner or homeowners association who will take long term responsibility for
these SCMs, is accepted by the Village Engineer.
2. _(b)_ Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the Village of Chagrin Falls may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding
issues with all stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder
of the bond shall be given to the private lot owner/ homeowners association for
the purpose of long term maintenance of the project.  
(Ord. 2016-79. Passed 12-12-16.)

## 1357.16   Installation of water quality stormwater control measures

The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site
is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
