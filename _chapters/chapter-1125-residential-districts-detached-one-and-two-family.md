    1. _(1)_ Certain architectural features may project from a dwelling into any
setback a maximum distance of three feet. However, no such feature shall
extend to within three feet of a side lot line or into a setback any distance
greater than a setback line that has been established by a variance. For
purposes of this subsection, architectural features shall include awnings,
balconies, bay windows, belt courses, canopies, cornices, projecting eaves and
other overhangs.
    2. _(2)_ Entrance features not exceeding forty-eight (48) square feet may

12. _(l)_ Modifications to Required Front Yard Setback. For a lot located on a
block which is occupied along at least fifty percent (50%) of its frontage by
one or two-family detached dwellings, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
establish a front yard setback equal to the average existing setback of
dwellings located within 100 feet on either side of the lot proposed for
development. However, the front yard setback shall not be less than two-thirds
of that established in subsection (f) hereof.
13. _(m)_ Street Frontage on Curved Streets. For lots which front on a curved
street segment, the minimum street frontage required in subsection (c) hereof
shall be reduced in proportion to the degree of curvature. The minimum
permitted street frontage for such lots shall be that distance which results
from side lot lines drawn as radials of the circle(s) formed from the front lot
line.
14. _(n)_ Garages. Each dwelling unit shall be served by a garage located on
the same lot. An attached garage is part of the main building when a wall or

project into any setback a maximum distance of three feet, but in no event
shall such feature extend to less than three feet from any lot line. For
purposes of this subsection, architectural features shall include awnings,
balconies, bay windows, belt courses, canopies, cornices, projecting eaves and
other overhangs. Entrance features shall include steps, landings, platforms
and unenclosed porches.
    4. _(4)_ For corner lots, the minimum distance from the side street line
shall be five feet plus the setback for the main building.

        2. _(B)_ The maximum height shall not exceed that of the main building;
        3. _(C)_ Regardless of the height of the building, the maximum height of
the sidewalls of a garage shall not exceed ten feet from the floor of the
garage to the top of the sidewall; and
        4. _(D)_ The distance of an accessory building from the side and rear lot
lines shall increase by one foot for each foot over eighteen feet in building
height. Where the computation results in a fractional unit, the requirement
shall be rounded up to the closest foot.
    7. _(7)_ No portion of an accessory building may be occupied for residential
use.
2. _(b)_ Driveways. Driveways shall be permitted in accordance with the
following standards:
    1. _(1)_ Each dwelling unit shall be served by a driveway located on the

    2. _(2)_ When not considered a large vehicle, the outside parking and
storage of trailers shall conform to the following:
        1. _(A)_ The trailer shall be located only in a rear yard, a minimum
distance of three feet from any lot line plus the width of required screening.
On a corner lot, the trailer may be parked no closer to the street than five
feet plus the setback for the main building plus the width of required
screening.
        2. _(B)_ The Administrator may require an increase in setbacks if
necessary, for the installation of adequate screening.
        3. _(C)_ The trailer shall be screened as required under Section 1125.08(f) so as to obscure it from adjacent parcels and public streets when
viewed from adjacent parcels and public streets by a person standing at ground
level. The Administrator may exclude from the screening requirement an area of
sufficient width to serve as an approach for the trailer.
        4. _(D)_ The wheels or any similar devices of any trailer shall not be
removed except for repairs, nor shall such trailer be otherwise permanently
fixed to the ground in a manner that would prevent ready removal.
        5. _(E)_ No trailer shall be parked, stored or allowed to remain on a lot
or parcel of land that is not improved with a main building being used for a
permitted main use of the lot.
6. _(f)_ Screening. Screening shall consist of a planted area that provides a
year-round, continuous, visual screen to an initial height of at least eight
feet and an initial depth of at least ten feet. At a minimum, such planted
area shall consist of two staggered rows of evergreen (non-deciduous)
vegetation. Landscaped earth mounds and fencing may supplement the planted
screen in order to achieve the required screen density and height. The
Administrator shall determine the effectiveness of the selected screening. The
screening requirement shall not apply where natural or man-made barriers exist
which provide continual screening generally equivalent to that required by this
Section. Screening shall be maintained in good condition at all times.
