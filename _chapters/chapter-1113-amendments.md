## 1113.01   Intent

This Planning and Zoning Code may be amended periodically in order to keep pace
with new zoning techniques and changes in enabling legislation governing
municipal planning and zoning. The Code may also be amended when a general
hardship prevails in a given area, when new extensive developments affecting the
use of land are being planned.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1113.02   Initiation of amendment

A proposed amendment to the zoning text or Map may be initiated either by a
property owner, the Mayor, Planning and Zoning Commission or a member of
Council. If initiated by a property owner, the Mayor or Council, the ordinance
to amend the Planning and Zoning Code shall be referred to the Commission
before action is taken by Council.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1113.03   Action by commission

The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve or disapprove a proposed
amendment, either in whole or in part, and submit its recommendation to
Council.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1113.04   Action by council

1. _(a)_ Upon receiving the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission
on a proposed amendment, or in the event no action is taken by the Commission on
the proposed amendment within 45 days after (i) the referral by Council, or (ii)
60 days after a complete rezoning application is received from a property owner,
Council shall hold a public hearing. For all proposed text or Map amendments,
notice shall conform to the requirements of [Section 1109.09][CFCO 1109.09] of
the Planning and Zoning Code.

2. _(b)_ After the public hearing, Council may adopt the proposal whether it is
recommended or not recommended by the Commission by majority vote of those
elected to Council. If Council modifies the proposal, it may resubmit the
proposed modification to the Commission for further consideration. The Clerk of
Council shall submit to the Commission a copy of any action taken by Council in
regard to the Planning and Zoning Code.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19; Ord. 2019-56. Passed 11-25-19.)

## 1113.05   Current record of text and map

The Administrator shall maintain a permanent and current record of the Planning
and Zoning Code showing all amendments to the text and Map.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1113.06   Determination of similar uses

1. _(a)_ Upon application for a permit for a building or use not specifically
listed in any of the permitted building or use classifications in any of the
districts, or on its own initiative, additions or clarifications thereto may be
made by the Planning and Zoning Commission, in compliance with the following
standards:

    1. _(1)_ Such use is not listed in any other classification of permitted
    buildings or uses and is not specifically prohibited in this Planning and
    Zoning Code;

    2. _(2)_ Such use is more appropriate to, and conforms more closely to the
    basic characteristics of the classification to which it is to be added than
    to any other classification;

    3. _(3)_ Such use does not create dangers to health and safety, and does not
    create offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare or other
    objectionable influences to an extent greater than the other uses listed in
    the classification to which it is to be added; and

    4. _(4)_ Such use does not generate traffic to a greater extent than the
    other uses listed in the classification to which it is to be added.

2. _(b)_ The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend such additions or
clarifications to Council. If Council, by a majority vote of its members,
concurs with the recommendation of the Commission, such use shall be deemed to
be similar and permitted in the requested use district. No public hearing shall
be required to include the similar use in a use district.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
