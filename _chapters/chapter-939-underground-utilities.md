## 939.01   Purpose

The Village has invested considerable sums of money to provide capacity
(i.e. conduit) so that certain utilities and similar uses, the services for
which are frequently provided by cables, wires and similar facilities located
on poles above ground, may be placed underground. In order to protect and
preserve the aesthetics and property values of the Downtown District, it is the
purpose of this chapter to ensure future utility services will locate such
facilities underground.\

## 939.02   Downtown district

All public utilities, and similar uses, the services of which are conveyed
over cables, wires or similar facilities, and which will be located in the
Downtown District, shall be required to use existing underground conduit and
other underground facilities for such cables, wires or similar facilities, as
directed by the Chief Administrative Officer, and no poles or other above-
ground structures may be erected or used for the support of such cables, wires
or similar facilities. For purposes of this chapter, the Downtown District
shall be those streets described in Section 903.02(c).\
