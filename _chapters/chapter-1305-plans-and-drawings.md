## 1305.01   Consideration of applications

All applications, plans and specifications shall be dated by the Building
Inspector and taken up in their regular order as received. No plans or
specifications shall be passed out of their order unless buildings or
structures are of a complex character which require prolonged examination and
inspection.\
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1305.02   Plot plan

The plot plan shall show the exact placement of all buildings, existing or
to be erected, with distances from lot lines and setbacks, according to the
following scale:

1. _(a)_ When the lot shown is less than 100 feet in its narrowest dimensions
and 200 feet in length, the scale may be one-sixteenth or one-twentieth of an
inch per foot;

2. _(b)_ When the lot exceeds either of the above dimensions, the scale may be
one thirty- second or one-fortieth of an inch per foot.\
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40)

## 1305.03   Building plans

1. _(a)_ No building plans except those for minor alterations shall be approved
unless such plans have been prepared by an architect.

2. _(b)_ All plans shall be neatly and legibly prepared in such a manner as to
permit legible and serviceable copies to be made therefrom. Triplicate sets of
such reproductions shall be submitted as part of each application for a
building permit, except that applications for permits to make minor alterations
need not be accompanied by reproductions of plans, when, in the opinion of the
Building Inspector, such plans are unnecessary. It shall be the duty of the
Inspector to examine plans and, upon approval, to stamp and attach his
signature to each of the three sets submitted. He shall retain two of the
stamped approved sets for his files and deliver one set to the applicant at the
time of issuing the permit. A stamped and approved set of drawings shall be
kept on the job for which a permit is issued from the beginning of construction
until final acceptance of the work by the Inspector. If so requested at the
time the triplicate reproductions of drawings are submitted, the Inspector
shall stamp and approve a fourth set of drawings for the applicant.

3. _(c)_ No plans shall be approved unless all essential floor plans,
elevations, cross-sections and details of construction are accurately shown,
including horizontal and vertical dimensions, thickness of walls, dimensions
and materials of supporting members and such other information as may be
essential to illustrate completely the work covered by the application.\
(Ord. 1965-616. Passed 6-14-65.)

4. _(d)_ Whenever, in the opinion of the Inspector, the plans submitted include
structural members, the size, proportions or design of which necessitate
approval by a qualified structural engineer, he may require the applicant to
furnish certification as to the sufficiency of the design by a registered
structural engineer. The form of certification shall be subject to the approval
of the Inspector.\
(Ord. 1980-5. Passed 1-28-80.)

5. _(e)_ The Inspector may waive the requirements as to certification when, in
his opinion, such separate certification is unnecessary. The originals of all
certifications and copies of all waivers of certification shall be made a part
of the permanent files of the Inspector's office.\
(Ord. 1965-616. Passed 6-14-65.)

## 1305.04   Specifications

Specifications shall be filed with all plans submitted with applications for
construction permits and with all other applications for permits where, in the
opinion of the Building Inspector, specifications are necessary in order to
describe the work under consideration. All specifications shall completely and
correctly describe the work to be performed, including the types and grades of
materials to be used, the manner in which the work is to be performed and the
make and grade of manufactured products, with complete, identifying
descriptions of equipment to be installed.\
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1305.05   Imperfect plans and specifications

If the matter mentioned in any application for a permit or in the plans and
specifications accompanying and illustrating the same indicates to the Building
Inspector that the work to be done is not clearly or specifically defined or is
imperfect or is not in all respects in accordance with the provisions of this
Building Code, he shall refuse to issue a permit until such application and
plans and specifications have been made to conform in every respect with the
requirements thereof. All plans not properly dimensioned shall be deemed
incomplete.\
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1305.06   Alteration or erasure of plans

No person shall erase, alter or modify any lines, figures or coloring
contained upon any such drawings or specifications filed with the Building
Inspector. If during the progress of the execution of such work, it is desired
to deviate in any manner affecting the construction or other essential of the
building from the terms of the application, plans or specifications, notice of
such intention to alter or deviate shall be given in writing to the Inspector
and his written assent shall be obtained before such alteration or deviation
may be made. If such change or deviation affects the bearing or structural
parts of such building, or its classification or grade of occupancy, new plans
thereof shall be submitted to the Inspector for approval.\
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1305.99   Penalty
