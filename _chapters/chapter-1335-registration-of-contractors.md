## 1335.01   Purposes

It is hereby found and determined to be in the best interest of the health,
safety and welfare of the Village, its property owners and inhabitants to
require the registration of contractors performing construction work within the
Village. The purposes of such registration are:

1. _(a)_ Registration ensures that Village property owners and inhabitants have
some measure of protection that the contractor will perform the work in
accordance with approved plans and specifications, and follows all applicable
laws; and

2. _(b)_ Registration allows the Village to ensure that contractors withhold and
pay income taxes on behalf of their employees for work performed in the
Village. \
(Ord. 2006-48. Passed 7-24-06.)

## 1335.02   Registration required

No plumbing or sewer work shall be performed, or heating or electrical equipment
shall be installed, in any building or structure or upon any property or within

a person registered to perform plumbing or sewer work, or install heating or
electrical equipment, or by a firm or corporation employing a person registered
pursuant to the terms of this chapter. No general contracting shall be done
within the Municipality unless the same is done by a person registered to do
general contracting, except where the work is of a minor nature and pursuant to

heating or electrical equipment, which qualification certificate has been issued
