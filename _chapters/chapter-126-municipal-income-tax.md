6. _(f)_ On the portion attributable to the Municipality pursuant to the terms
of this chapter and including:

    1. _(1)_ **Royalty income.** Income earned by a taxpayer from a royalty
    interest in the production of an oil or gas well whether managed, extracted
    or operated by the taxpayer individually or through an agent or other

        the production of an oil or gas well in a taxable year exceeds three
        thousand dollars ($3,000) it shall be prima-facie evidence that the

    by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the withheld income tax
    to the Municipality in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
    Since the individual can no longer be considered to have been an occasional

## Determination of allocation of tax

### 126.0701   Method of determination

In the taxation of income which is subject to the municipal income tax, the
portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been
derived from within the Municipality shall be determined as follows:

1. _(a)_ Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to
be determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:

    1. _(1)_ The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
    property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
    Municipality during the taxable period to the average net book value of all
    the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
    business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
    subsection (a)(1) hereof, real property includes property rented or leased
    by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
    multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.

    2. _(2)_ Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
    period to persons employed in the business or profession for services
    performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries and other compensation paid
    during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,
    wherever their services are performed.

    3. _(3)_ Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
    services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to gross
    receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
    services, wherever made or performed.

2. _(b)_ In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, the Administrator may approve the use of books and records as
a substitute method, by applying the following:

    1. _(1)_ The net profits allocable to the Municipality from business,
    profession or other activities conducted in the Municipality by corporations
    or unincorporated entities (whether resident or non-resident) may be
    determined from the records of the taxpayer only if the taxpayer has bona
    fide records which disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of his net
    profits is attributable to that part of his activities conducted within the
    Municipality.

    2. _(2)_ If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the basis for
    apportioning net profits, a statement must accompany the return explaining
    the manner in which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to
    enable the Administrator to determine whether the net profits attributable
    to the Municipality are apportioned with reasonable accuracy.

    3. _(3)_ In determining the income allocable to the Municipality from the
    books and records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the
    contribution made to the production of such income by headquarters
    activities of the taxpayer, whether such headquarters is within or without
    the Municipality.\
    (Ord. 1968-730. Passed 6-18-68; Ord. 2005-44. Passed 7-11-05.)

### 126.0702   Sales made in the municipality

As used in [Section 126.0701(c)][] sales made in the Municipality means:

1. _(a)_ All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Municipality.

2. _(b)_ All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Municipality if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its
own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Municipality
and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.

3. _(c)_ All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the Municipality to purchasers outside of the Municipality regardless of
where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is
made.\
(Ord. 1968-730. Passed 6-18-68.)

### 126.0703   Total allocation

Add together the percentages determined in accordance with [Section
126.0701(a)][CF Section 126.0701(a)], [(b)][CF Section 126.0701(b)] and [(c)][CF
Section 126.0701(c)] or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to
the particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving such total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in [Section 126.0701][CF Section 126.0701].

Municipality by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other
corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or

successor employer shall withhold from any purchase price that the successor
owes to the predecessor an amount sufficient to pay all unpaid taxes, interest
and penalty which the predecessor employer owes pursuant to this chapter. The
successor employer shall make such withholding until such time that the

employee, and shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a return and
pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted during the previous

3. _(c)_ Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same
until payment is made by such employer to the Municipality as a trustee for the
benefit of the Municipality, and any such tax collected by such employer from
his employees shall, until the same is paid to the Municipality, be deemed a
trust fund in the hands of such employer.

4. _(d)_ No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about such
person's residence, even though such residence is in the Municipality, but such

    trust, whether actually collected by such employer or not. Any tax deducted
    and withheld is to be considered paid to the Municipality, whether or not
    the employer actually remits the tax to the Municipality, for purposes of
    determining employee payments or credits.

    2. _(2)_ All managers shall be personally liable to the extent of the tax,
    interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the
    employer's return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as
    required under this chapter.

    3. _(3)_ No change in structure by an employer, including a fundamental
    change, discharges its managers from liability for the employees' or
    manager's failure to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to
    pay taxes.\
