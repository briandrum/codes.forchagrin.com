## 1350.01   Intent

In addition to the provisions of the intent stated in Section 1105.03, it is the
intent of these regulations to ensure the following health, safety and aesthetic
objectives:

1. _(a)_ To limit interference with natural sunlight and the circulation of air
and to preserve space for trees and other plants;

2. _(b)_ To minimize the potential of dish antennas to block views, impair
security, hinder utility or emergency access, pose safety hazards, particularly
in high wind conditions, and accumulate weeds and debris underneath;

3. _(c)_ To reduce visual impact of dish antennas on the distinctive nature of
both old and new homes, and to preserve property values;

4. _(d)_ To preserve the historic character of the Village of Chagrin Falls as
evidenced by the designation of the Village as a historical district, which
designation has been based in large part upon the architectural and other
aesthetic qualities of both residential and commercial districts within the
Village;

5. _(e)_ To preserve pre-historic or historic sites, buildings, structures or
objects included in, or eligible for inclusion on, the National Register of
Historic Places; and

6. _(f)_ To establish regulations which are reasonable and necessary to achieve
the stated objectives.  
(Ord. 2000-95. Passed 11-27-00.)

## 1350.02   Definition

"Dish-type, satellite signal-receiving earth station", sometimes referred to
hereinafter as earth station or dish antenna, means an antenna of dish shape
that is accessory to a permitted main building and installed for the purpose of
receiving signals related to communications for satellite transmissions.  
(Ord. 2000-95. Passed 11-27-00.)

## 1350.03   Permit not required

A permit is not required for the following types of dish antennas:

1. _(a)_ Satellite dish antennas that are one meter (39 inches) or less in
diameter may be located in any residential zoning district subject to the

    antenna shall be mounted only upon the portion of any hip, gable or gambrel
    roof that faces the rear yard and shall not exceed the maximum height of the
    roof upon which it is mounted. On flat roofs, the dish antenna shall be set
    back from the building face a distance at least equal to the height by which
    it exceeds the building height.

    2. _(2)_ If not attached to the main building, such dish antenna, including
    its base or substructure, shall be located in a side or rear yard no less
    than ten feet from any lot line.

## 1350.05   Application for permit; plans

Any owner who desires to construct or erect a satellite dish-type earth station
may apply to the Administrator for the permit as required by this Chapter.

1. _(a)_ **Narrative Information.**

    1. _(1)_ The applicant shall submit the permit application upon forms
    provided by the Administrator.

    2. _(2)_ A part-owner, occupant or renter must submit documentation of
    written permission from the owner of the lot, premises or parcel of land
    within the Village on which such construction or erected satellite station
    is proposed.

    3. _(3)_ The application shall indicate the owner or owners of the subject
    property, the occupant of the subject premises and the contractor or other
    person who will be permitted to construct or erect the proposed satellite
    dish earth station.

    4. _(4)_ The applicant shall also submit documentation demonstrating that
    the dish antenna must be sited in the proposed location. If the size of the
    proposed dish antenna is greater than one meter in residential districts and
    greater than two meters in nonresidential districts, documentation shall be
    submitted indicating that such size is technically necessary.

2. _(b)_ **Plans.**

    1. _(1)_ The applicant shall submit a plot plan of the lot, premises or
    parcel of land, showing the exact location of the proposed earth station and
    the location of all buildings on the subject lot and a description of the
    kind of earth station dish proposed.

    2. _(2)_ In addition to all other application requirements, nonresidential
    applications shall include three complete sets of construction plans,
    specifications and elevations of the proposed location with sufficient
    details to show the method of assembly and construction. Each set of plans
    and specifications shall show the complete name and address of the subject
    property owner and the complete name and address of the person who prepared
    the plans and specifications. The Administrator may require construction
    plans to be certified with a Professional Engineer's stamp.

3. _(c)_ **Review.**

    1. _(1)_ The Administrator shall review the submitted application and shall
    note thereon whether all of the requirements of this chapter have been
    satisfied. The Administrator may waive any of the above requirements that he
    determines to be inapplicable in specific instances. The provisions of the
    Building and Planning and Zoning Codes, so far as they are consistent with
    this chapter and applicable hereto, shall also apply to the construction of
    an earth station, except for additional permit fees.

    2. _(2)_ Once the requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, the
    application shall be referred to the Architectural Review Board, which shall
    review the application for compliance with Chapter 1146.
