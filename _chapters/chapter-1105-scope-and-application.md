1. _(a)_ Buildings and land shall be used; and the use of buildings and land
shall be changed or extended; and buildings shall be designed and erected; and
existing buildings or uses shall be altered, converted, enlarged, reconstructed
or moved only in conformance with this Planning and Zoning Code.

2. _(b)_ The provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code shall be considered as
minimum requirements and shall be literally construed to further its underlying
purposes and objectives. They shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
building, structure or land. Where the provisions of this Planning and Zoning
Code impose greater restrictions upon buildings, structures, uses or land than
imposed or required by other codes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations or
restrictive covenants running with the land, this Planning and Zoning Code shall
govern; and conversely, other regulations shall govern where they are more
restrictive than this Planning and Zoning Code.

3. _(c)_ The classification of districts set forth in Chapter 1119 shall not be
construed as an enumeration of most restrictive to least restrictive districts.
Neither shall it be construed that a use permitted in a certain district shall
be permitted in a district which is enumerated subsequently, unless such use is
specifically listed as permitted in such subsequent district.

4. _(d)_ This Planning and Zoning Code shall not be construed as removing or
rendering inoperative any deed or land restriction established by restrictive
covenants running with the land, easements or other agreements between parties.

structures, uses and land of any political subdivision, district, taxing unit or
bond issuing authority of the State, including the State, located within the
corporate limits of the Municipality.\

(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1105.06   Relation to other regulations

In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code,
they shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare.

1. _(a)_ Except as specifically herein provided, the provisions of this Planning
and Zoning Code shall not annul existing deed or plat restrictions, codes, laws,
rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued.

2. _(b)_ Where this Planning and Zoning Code is more restrictive as to the use
of structures, buildings or land, and/or limits the height or bulk of buildings,
or requires larger areas and yards than are required by other deed or plat
restrictions, codes, laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, this Planning and
Zoning Code shall govern; and conversely, other regulations shall govern where
they are more restrictive in nature than this Planning and Zoning Code.

3. _(c)_ This Planning and Zoning Code shall not be construed as removing or
rendering inoperative any deed or land restriction formerly established by
restrictive covenants running with the land, easements or other agreements
between parties.

4. _(d)_ Unless specifically provided otherwise in this Planning and Zoning
Code, if the requirements of an Overlay District conflict with the requirements
of the underlying district or any other provision of Municipality regulations,
the requirements of the Overlay District shall govern.

5. _(e)_ Sale of Firearms.

    1. _(1)_ As used in this section "firearm" shall have the same meaning as in
    section 2923.11 of the Ohio Revised Code.

    2. _(2)_ The commercial storage, sale or manufacture of firearms, firearm
    components, or ammunition for firearms is permitted by an owner or

## 1105.07   Separability

If any provision, or the application of any provision, of this Planning and
Zoning Code or amendments thereto is declared to be invalid by a judicial
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, the effect of such determination
shall be limited to that provision or provisions expressly stated to be invalid,
and such determination shall not affect, impair or nullify this Planning and
Zoning Code as amended as a whole or any other part thereof.\
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1105.08   Imposition of conditions

Whenever the Council, any board, commission, Village Engineer, Chief
Administrative Officer, Administrator, or Building Inspector (collectively
"Approving Authority") has been delegated the power to approve plans, issue
permits, for improvements, development, construction, reconstruction, or
renovation of land, buildings and structures as provided for in the Planning and
Zoning Code, such Approving Authority may impose conditions, so long as such
conditions are in compliance with any applicable statutes, ordinances and
standards, on any such approval with such conditions the Approving Authority
believes are necessary to impose in order that the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort and general welfare of the residents and the Village may be
safeguarded and substantial justice done.\
