the speed at which the unit is operated on the street or highway. The speed
identification symbol shall indicate the maximum speed in miles per hour at
which the unit of farm machinery is designed by its manufacturer to operate. The
display of the speed identification symbol shall be in accordance with the

enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated on
any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section or
causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of
subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a

recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.

9. _(i)_ Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that

vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster seat,

same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a single
violation of this section:

    in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But
    the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
    the Ohio rules of evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged
    in the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
    represents noneconomic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort
    action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to

    was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with
    the Rules of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the
    available occupant restraining device, was not wearing all of the available
    elements of such a device, or was not wearing such a device as properly
    adjusted is admissible in evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a
    tort action to the extent that the claim for relief satisfies all of the
    following:

        1. _(A)_ It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
        occupant.

        distributor or seller of the passenger car.

        3. _(C)_ The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
        the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated
        by some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was
        not crashworthy.
