## 353.03   Regulation of parking in metered zones

1. _(a)_ Whenever a vehicle is parked in a metered parking zone where a parking
meter has been installed, the person parking such vehicle shall either (i)
register the vehicle in a Village of Chagrin Falls approved mobile parking
application system and pay for the parking permitted by such meter by payment
through a mobile parking application system approved and used by the Village of
Chagrin Falls, where the parking meter payment may be made by a mobile payment
application system when so designated, or (ii) deposit in such parking meter a
coin of United States money of the denomination designated on the plates
attached to such parking meter, if such meter displays the signal showing that
legal parking is only permitted on such deposit. If such parking meter
requires the movement of a lever or other device, as well as the deposit of a
coin, to cause the meter to operate, the person so depositing the coin shall
immediately so move the lever as to set the meter in operation. The coins
required to deposit in parking meters shall be set forth on the parking meter.
Notice to the public shall be given by appropriate signs setting forth the
length of time for which parking is permitted, the hours when payment for
metered parking is required within the Village and the conditions for parking
either using a mobile parking payment application system or paying by
depositing coins in the parking meter. The notice may be upon the parking
meter stand or in the immediate vicinity. Any vehicle which remains in a
metered parking zone after the prescribed time for parking has elapsed is
hereby determined to be illegally parked. At each place where metered parking
zones are so established as provided in Section 353.01, and are so marked off, each vehicle shall be parked entirely within a
metered parking zone.  
(Ord. 2017-74. Passed 11-13-17.)
2. _(b)_ The provisions of this section shall not apply to vehicles parked upon
the streets of the Municipality between the hours of 6:00 p. m. until 9:00 a.
m. the following morning, or upon Sundays or holidays. For the purposes of this
section Saturday afternoon shall not be considered a holiday.  
(Ord. 1968-735. Passed 9-17-68.)

## 353.04   Unlawful parking in metered zones

1. _(a)_ No person shall park or cause, allow or permit to be parked any
vehicle owned or operated by such person in any parking space without
depositing the coin designated in Section 353.03 in the slot provided in such parking meter, and, if a hand-operated
parking meter is installed, without turning the lever on the parking meter as
far as it will go.
2. _(b)_ No person shall cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered
in his name to be parked over-time or beyond the lawful period of time
prescribed by the provisions of this chapter as herein provided.
3. _(c)_ No person shall cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle owned or
operated by such person to be parked on any line designating a metered parking
zone. Any vehicle parked contrary to these provisions shall be deemed to be
illegally parked. The fact that a vehicle is in a metered parking zone when the
time signal on the parking meter for the same shows no parking permitted,
unless a deposit of a coin is made as provided in this chapter, shall be deemed
prima-facie evidence of the unlawful parking of such vehicle by its owner.  
(Ord. 1954-326. Passed 12-13-54.)
4. _(d)_ It shall be unlawful for the driver, or the person in charge of a
vehicle, or any person during, or at the expiration of any maximum authorized
period of parking, to again insert or cause to be inserted the prescribed fee
in the parking meter so as to set the parking meter in operation for an
addition time period beyond the original maximum authorized period.  
(Ord. 2000-67. Passed 9-25-00.)
5. _(e)_ It shall be unlawful for the driver, or the person in charge of a
vehicle, to park a vehicle within the Central Shopping District, as designated
on the Zone Map of the Municipality of Chagrin Falls, as provided for in
Section 1119.03 for more than three total hours in any nine hour span anywhere in the
Central Shopping District between the hours of 9AM and 6PM during the weekdays
of Monday through Friday, except that the provisions of this Section shall not
apply to vehicles parked on the streets of the Village on declared holidays.  
(Ord. 2019-15. Passed 3-11-19.)

## 353.05   Prima-facie evidence of unlawful parking

In any hearing before the Mayor or other magistrate or the Bedford Municipal
Court, having jurisdiction over a charge of illegally parking a motor vehicle,
testimony that a vehicle bearing a certain license plate was found unlawfully
parked as prohibited by the provisions of this chapter, and further testimony
that the records of the Registrar or the Deputy Registrar of Motor Vehicles for
the State show that such license plate was issued to the defendant, shall be
prima-facie evidence that the vehicle which was unlawfully parked was so parked
by the defendant. A certified copy showing such fact from such Registrar or
Deputy Registrar of the State shall be proof of such ownership.  
(Ord. 2017-74. Passed 11-13-17.)

## 353.06   Collection of coins from meters

A member of the Police Department, as designated by the Chief of Police,
shall have charge of the collection of the coins deposited in the parking
meters and shall deposit the same on the day collected with the local bank
depository for the Village of Chagrin Falls, as determined by Ordinance of the
Village Council. A complete and accurate record shall be maintained at all
times of the time and amount of each collection, and a receipt for each
deposit, indicating the number of coin bags received at the local bank
depository for the Village shall be provided by such officer to the Clerk of
Council.  
(Ord. 2017-74. Passed 11-13-17.)

involved in the inspection, installation, operation, control and use of metered
parking zones and parking meters mentioned herein and in checking and
regulating the parking spaces where parking meters have been installed. The
payments shall be made to the general fund and shall be applied as determined
by Village Council.  
(Ord. 2017-74. Passed 11-13-17.)
