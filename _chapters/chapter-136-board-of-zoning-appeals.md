of the Municipality, none of whom shall hold any other municipal office or
appointment in the Village of Chagrin Falls, to be appointed for terms of four
years by the Mayor, subject to the confirmation by a majority vote of the
members of Council. Those members in office on the effective date of this
provisions shall be permitted to complete their term of appointment, even if
they are in contravention of this section.

2. _(b)_ Up to three alternate members of the Board of Zoning Appeals may be
appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by a majority vote of the members of
Council. The alternate members shall serve whenever one or more members are
unable to hear a particular matter, or are unavailable for a particular meeting.
None of the alternate members shall be members of Council and shall not
simultaneously hold an appointment to the Planning Commission, but shall be
electors of the municipality and shall not hold any other municipal office or
appointment in the Village of Chagrin Falls. Each alternate member shall be
appointed for a term of four years.

3. _(c)_ A vacancy occurring during the term of any member shall be filled for
