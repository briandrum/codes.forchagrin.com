and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by
legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\
(ORC 1.42)

2. _(b)_ **Singular and Plural; Gender; Tense.** As used in the Codified
Ordinances, unless the context otherwise requires:

    3. _(3)_ The singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the
    singular.

    2. _(2)_ Words of one gender include the other genders.

    3. _(3)_ Words in the present tense include the future.\
    (ORC 1.43)

3. _(c)_ **Calendar; Computation of Time.**

    1. _(1)_ Definitions.

        1. _(A)_ "Week" means seven consecutive days.

        2. _(B)_ "Year" means twelve consecutive months.\
        (ORC 1.44)

    2. _(2)_ If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
    a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the
    concluding month as the day of the month from which the computation is
    begun, unless there are not that many days in the concluding month, in which
    case the period ends on the last day of that month.\
    (ORC 1.45)

    3. _(3)_ The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
    computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
    the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
    the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday. When a
    public office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is closed
    to the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for doing
    such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may be
    performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal
    holiday. If any legal holiday falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day is a
    legal holiday.\
    (ORC 1.14)

    after a day named, no part of that day shall be included.\
    (ORC 1.15)

    5. _(5)_ In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a

three or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving
such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall
be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.

6. _(f)_ **Exceptions.** The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.

## 101.04   Revivor; effect of amendment or repeal

1. _(a)_ The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.\
(ORC 1.57)

2. _(b)_ An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is the
same as the prior ordinance.\
(ORC 1.54)

3. _(c)_ The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

    1. _(1)_ Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
    taken thereunder;

    2. _(2)_ Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
    liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

    3. _(3)_ Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
    incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

    4. _(4)_ Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
    such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment;
    and the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
    enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
    ordinance had not been repealed or amended.

4. _(d)_ If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.\
(ORC 1.58)

## 101.05   Construction of section references

1. _(a)_ A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.\
(ORC 1.55)

2. _(b)_ If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.\
(ORC 1.56)

3. _(c)_ Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.

    References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
    designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case,
    action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which
    is superseded by the Codified Ordinances.\
    (ORC 1.23)

## 101.06   Conflicting provisions

1. _(a)_ If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.\
(ORC 1.46)

2. _(b)_ If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.\
(ORC 1.51)

3. _(c)_

    1. _(1)_ If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
    irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

    2. _(2)_ If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
    meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the
    amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to
    each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date
    of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language
    deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an
    earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
    Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot
    reasonably be put into simultaneous operation.\
    (ORC 1.52)

## 101.07   Determination of legislative intent

1. _(a)_ In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

    1. _(1)_ Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
    States is intended;

    2. _(2)_ The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;

    3. _(3)_ A just and reasonable result is intended;

    4. _(4)_ A result feasible of execution is intended.\
    (ORC 1.47)

2. _(b)_ An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.\
(ORC 1.48)

3. _(c)_ If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:

    1. _(1)_ The object sought to be attained;

    2. _(2)_ The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;

    3. _(3)_ The legislative history;

    4. _(4)_ The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
    upon the same or similar subjects;

    5. _(5)_ The consequences of a particular construction;

    6. _(6)_ The administrative construction of the ordinance.\
    (ORC 1.49)

## 101.08   Severability

If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.\
(ORC 1.50)

## 101.99   General penalty

Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the Municipality,
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a
misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do
any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise
provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a fine not
exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.
