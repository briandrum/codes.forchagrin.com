- Passed (08/08/16)

_Whereas,_ the Village has made every effort to reduce cost and has proposed
further cost cutting, but as a result of State actions that have depleted the
Village of inheritance tax revenue and a portion of the local government tax the
Village is currently without the resources to maintain infrastructure; and

_Whereas,_ the Council believes that a proposed income tax is a reasonable way
to raise the funds required to finance vital capital replacement and maintenance
projects for the Road and Infrastructure Improvements and during budget reviews
the Council has specifically identified individual projects for which the
additional income tax increase would be allocated; and

_Whereas,_ the Village currently imposes a municipal income tax at the rate of
one and one-halfpercent (1.5%) which is lower than most communities in the
Chagrin Valley area; and

_Whereas,_ this Council finds that it is necessary to increase the income tax
rate from one and one-half percent (1.5%) to one and eighty-five hundredths
percent (1.85%), and the increase of thirty-five one-hundredths percent (0.35%)
in the income tax rate shall be allocated solely to the Permanent Improvement
Fund; and

_Whereas,_ the proposed increase, if approved by the electors, would provide the
Village additional resources for permanent improvements.

**_Now Therefore, Be It Ordained by the Council of the Village of Chagrin Falls,
Cuyahoga County, State of Ohio:_**
