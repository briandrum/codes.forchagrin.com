_Whereas,_ the Village Council has determined that a quarterly fixed capital improvement charge of Thirty-Five Dollars ($35.00) should be imposed on each sewer customer account in order to pay the existing debt in twenty years.

**_Now Therefore, Be It Ordained by the Council of the Village of Chagrin Falls, Cuyahoga County, State of Ohio:_**
