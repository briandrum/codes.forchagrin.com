- Introduced by: DeBernardo
- 1st Reading (10/23/2023)

_Whereas,_ the Village Council has determined that the place and manner of
posting of ordinances and resolutions should be revised from the current
provisions contained in [Section 113.01][CFCO 113.01] of the Codified Ordinances
of the Village, which currently provides that publication of ordinances and
resolutions shall be made once a week for two consecutive weeks on the same day
of each week in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or in the
case of posting a copy of the ordinance or resolution shall be posted for not
less than fifteen (15) days in the municipal building; and

_Whereas,_ Council has determined, based on changes made to publication or
posting of ordinances and resolutions set forth in Amended Substitute House Bill
No. 33, adopted in 2023, which allows publication by posting on the local
government’s website and social media accounts that the Village should provide
for posting on the Village website; and

_Whereas,_ the Village of Chagrin Falls does not currently have any social media
accounts other than the Village Police Department and the Village Council does
not want to share that website between the Police Department and other Village
departments; and

_Whereas,_ this Council finds that posting on the Village website is appropriate
and will provide the most likely resource to permit Village residents and
businesses to be aware of the adoption of such ordinances and resolutions; and

_Whereas,_ pursuant to [Article XVIII, Section 9][OC 18.9] of the Constitution
of the State of Ohio and the Charter of the Village of Chagrin Falls, this
Council has the right, by a two-thirds (⅔) majority affirmative vote, to submit
to the voters of the Village of Chagrin Falls proposed amendments to the Charter
of the Village of Chagrin Falls; and

_Whereas,_ this Council finds and determines that it is in the Village’s best
interest to submit to the electors of the Village of Chagrin Falls a proposed
amendment to the Charter which would provide for the posting of all ordinances
and resolutions required by law or ordinance to be published to allow posting on
the Village website as the sole requirement for publication of such enactments
and other actions of the Village; and

_Whereas,_ this Council chooses the date of March 19, 2024 for the election on
the Charter amendment proposal hereinafter set forth, which election is not less
than sixty (60) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days from date of
