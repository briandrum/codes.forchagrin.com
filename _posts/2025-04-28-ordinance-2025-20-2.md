_Whereas,_ the Village Council has control and ultimate decision-making authority for rules, regulations, policies and use of the parks and other public facilities owned by the Village of Chagrin Falls; and

_Whereas,_ the Village of Chagrin Falls Police Department has recommended that certain rules be adopted by the Village prohibiting opaque bags, backpacks and similar containers of a certain size from being brought into Riverside Park during the annual Blossom Time Festival as well as the Taste of Chagrin event in Triangle Park and North Franklin Street; and

_Whereas,_ the Village Council has determined that for the safety and health of the residents of the Village of Chagrin Falls and attendees of the Blossom Time Festival and the Taste of Chagrin events it is necessary to adopt rules to be strictly enforced by the sponsors of the event, the Village of Chagrin Falls Police Department and, where applicable, employees of the Village of Chagrin Falls.

1. _(a)_ The bag, backpack and similar container (collectively "Bag") Bag Safety Rules shall be in effect at all times the Blossom Time Festival event is open to the public in Riverside Park and when the Taste of Chagrin event occurs in Triangle Park and North Franklin Street, and the Bag Safety Rules shall also cover the public parks and roadways immediately adjacent to such parks.

4. _(d)_ All Bags that exceed 10 inches wide and 7 inches in height that are opaque or otherwise not clear where all contents would be visible are not permitted to be brought to the Blossom Time Festival event in the carnival area in the Riverside Park and the Taste of Chagrin event in Triangle Park and North Franklin Street, including the public parks and roadways immediately adjacent to such parks.

5. _(e)_ All Bags entering the Blossom Time Festival event and Taste of Chagrin event are subject to search by law enforcement officials.

6. _(f)_ Any person found having one or more Bags in their possession that exceeds 10 inches wide and 7 inches in height that are opaque or otherwise not clear and all contents in the Bag are not visible will not be allowed to access the Blossom Time Festival event in Riverside Park nor the Taste of Chagrin event in Triangle Park and North Franklin Street, including the public parks and roadways immediately adjacent to such parks.

7. _(g)_ Neither the Village nor sponsors of the events shall make provisions to store Bags that do not conform to the Bag Safety Rules and any person bringing any nonconforming Bag to such event(s) shall immediately remove them from Riverside Park, Triangle Park and North Franklin Street and the public parks and roadways immediately adjacent to such parks during the Blossom Time Festival event or the Taste of Chagrin event.

8. _(h)_ Any person carrying a Bag that exceeds 10 inches wide and 7 inches in height that is opaque or otherwise not clear who lawfully disposes of such Bag or removes it from the Blossom Time or Taste of Chagrin events may enter the events when in compliance with the Bag Safety Rules.

9. _(i)_ Signs must be posted at all entrance areas to the Blossom Time Festival event at Riverside Park and the Taste of Chagrin event at Triangle Park and North Franklin Street and clearly state the Bag Safety Rules requirements and that any items otherwise prohibited by law, such as weapons, alcoholic beverages, illicit drugs and similar prohibited items are not permitted to be brought to Riverside Park or Triangle Park and North Franklin Street during the Blossom Time Festival event and the Taste of Chagrin event.

**Section 2.** Codified Ordinance [Chapter 951][CFCO 951] shall be amended in accordance with the Bag Safety Rules set forth in Section 1 above.

**Section 5.** This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety of the inhabitants of the Village and for the further reason that it is necessary for this Ordinance to take immediate effect so that the Bag Safety Rules can be in effect prior to the commencement of the Blossom Time Festival event that occurs in May 2025; wherefore, provided it receives the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (â…”) of all members elected to Council, this Ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor, otherwise it shall take effect and be in force after the earliest period allowed by law.
