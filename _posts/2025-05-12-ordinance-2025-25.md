_Whereas,_ as a result of increased costs for eliminating ground water infiltration, necessary capital improvements and underground line replacement that is required and due to increased costs in the operation of the Village’s Waste Water Treatment Plant, it is necessary to amend the sanitary sewer rates being charged, in order that proper maintenance and service can be continued for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the residents and Waste Water Treatment Plant users;

_Whereas,_ it is necessary to amend certain portions of Codified Ordinances [Section 917.04(a)][CFCO 917.04(a)], [(b)][CFCO 917.04(b)] and [(h)][CFCO 917.04(h)] to reflect the amended sanitary sewer charges.

**_Now Therefore, Be It Ordained by the Council of the Village of Chagrin Falls, Cuyahoga County, State of Ohio:_**
