_Whereas,_ the Council for the Chagrin Falls adopted [Ordinance 2025-24][CFO 2025-24] to add [Subsection (k)][CFCO 917.04(k)] to [Section 917.04][CFCO 917.04] of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Chagrin Falls to impose a fixed capital improvement charge to each sewer customer account to reduce and ultimately pay the Wastewater Treatment Plant modernization improvement debt; and

_Whereas,_ the Village Council set the charge based on the size of a water meter utilized by the Village water customer and failed to establish how the quarterly fixed capital improvement charge would be assessed against those customers who only receive sewer service; and

_Whereas,_ the Village Council has determined that sewer service only customers should be charged the same capital charge as the smallest water meter sewer and water customer is charged by the Village.

**_Now Therefore, Be It Ordained by the Council of the Village of Chagrin Falls, Cuyahoga County, State of Ohio:_**

**Section 1.** That existing [Section 917.04(k)][CFCO 917.04(k)] is hereby amended to add the following to such subsection:

> 11. _(k)_ The quarterly fixed capital improvement charge applied to a sewer customer account that does not have water service from the Village shall be charged the same rate as a sewer customer who has a water meter of ¾ inch or less, effective July 1, 2025 for the October 25, 2025 billing period.

**Section 2.** This Ordinance shall be effective as to any sewer service only customer to commence at the same effective date as provided in [Ordinance 2025-24][CFO 2025-24] so there is no uncertainty of the rate to be charged to a sewer only customer, commencing July 1, 2025.

**Section 3.** That actions of this Council concerning and relating to the passage of this legislation were adopted in lawful meetings of this Council and that all deliberations of this Council and of any of its committees that resulted in such formal action were in compliance with all legal requirements, including [Chapter 114][CFCO 114] of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Chagrin Falls.

**Section 4.** That in accordance with [Section 113.01][CFCO 113.01] of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Chagrin Falls, public notice of this Ordinance shall be given by posting a copy thereof for not less than fifteen (15) days on the Village website.

**Section 5.** This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety of the inhabitants of the Village and for the further reason that this Ordinance must be immediately effective to provide for clarity for the capital improvement charge for sewer service only customers of the Village; wherefore, provided it receives the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (⅔) of all members elected to Council, this Ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor, otherwise it shall take effect and be in force after the earliest period allowed by law.
