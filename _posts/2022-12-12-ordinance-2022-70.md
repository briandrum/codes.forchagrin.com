_Whereas,_ Codified Ordinance [Section 305.01][] established a Traffic Control
Map to show at all times current traffic control matters and amendments may be
made to the Traffic Control Map pursuant to [Section 305.03][] of the Codified
Ordinances; and

_Whereas,_ the Village Council has determined that the Traffic Control Map needs
to be amended to provide that no left turn may be made when traveling eastbound
on River Street at its intersection with North Main Street so that vehicles
eastbound on River Street will not turn left and go northbound on North Main
Street since it has created dangerous conditions for pedestrians who are
lawfully in the North Main Street crosswalk at the point where left turning
vehicles from River Street would cross the crosswalk when going north on North
Main Street.

**_Now Therefore, Be It Ordained by the Council of the Village of Chagrin Falls,
Cuyahoga County, State of Ohio:_**

**Section 1.** [Appendix A to Chapter 305][] of the Codified Ordinances is
hereby amended, in part, to add the following no left turn requirement: Vehicles
are prohibited from turning left when traveling eastbound on River Street at its
intersection with North Main Street and all such traffic shall only turn right
and go southbound on North Main Street.

**Section 2.** The Police Department is hereby directed to amend the Traffic
Control Map in accordance with Section 1 and to enforce the no left turn
prohibition while traveling eastbound on River Street at the intersection with
North Main Street in accordance with the Traffic Control Map, as amended, from
and after the effective date of this Ordinance. A copy of the Traffic Control
Map, as so amended, shall be attached to and incorporated as part of the Traffic
Code.

**Section 3.** That actions of this Council concerning and relating to the
passage of this legislation were adopted in lawful meetings of this Council and
that all deliberations of this Council and of any of its committees that
resulted in such formal action were in compliance with all legal requirements,
including [Chapter 114][] of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Chagrin
Falls.

**Section 4.** That in accordance with [Section 113.01][] of the Codified
Ordinances of the Village of Chagrin Falls, public notice of this Ordinance
shall be given by posting a copy thereof for not less than fifteen (15) days in
the Village Hall.

**Section 5.** This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and
safety of the inhabitants of the Village and for the further reason that in
order to avoid injury or death to pedestrians utilizing the crosswalk on North
Main Street just north of its intersection with River Street, that left turns
from River Street should be immediately prohibited; wherefore, provided it
receives the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of all members
elected to Council, this Ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and
immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor, otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force after the earliest period allowed by law.
