_Whereas,_ Codified Ordinance [Section 305.01][CFCO 305.01] established a Traffic Control Map to show at all times current traffic control matters and amendments may be made to the Traffic Control Map pursuant to [Section 305.03][CFCO 305.03] of the Codified Ordinances; and

_Whereas,_ the Village Council has determined that (i) the Traffic Control Map needs to be amended to provide that the intersection of East Orange Street, North Street and Mill Street become a permanent 3-way stop which has been determined to be necessary after making it a temporary 3-way stop at the beginning of the Main Street Bridge Replacement Project and (ii) make the west side of Williams Street a No Parking Zone due to excessive spill-over parking from a contiguous restaurant that is impacting the neighborhood and it’s a short street with only one home on it.

**_Now Therefore, Be It Ordained by the Council of the Village of Chagrin Falls, Cuyahoga County, State of Ohio:_**

**Section 1.** Appendix A to [Chapter 305][CFCO 305] of the Codified Ordinances is hereby amended, in part, to add the following requirements:

1. _(A)_ The intersection of East Orange Street, North Street and Mill Street shall become a permanent 3-way stop with stop signs installed at each street of the intersection.

2. _(B)_ The west side of Williams Street is hereby designated as a No-Parking Zone and as a result both sides of Williams Street are hereby determined to be No-Parking Zones so that no parking shall be allowed on Williams Street at any time.

**Section 2.** The Police Department is hereby directed to amend the Traffic Control Map in accordance with Section 1 of this Ordinance, and to enforce the 3-way stop intersection at East Orange Street, North Street and Mill Street and to enforce the No-Parking Zone anywhere on Willimas [sic] Street in accordance with the Traffic Control Map, as amended, from and after the effective date of this Ordinance. A copy of the Traffic Control Map, as so amended, shall be attached to and incorporated as part of the Traffic Code.

**Section 3.** That actions of this Council concerning and relating to the passage of this legislation were adopted in lawful meetings of this Council and that all deliberations of this Council and of any of its committees that resulted in such formal action were in compliance with all legal requirements, including [Chapter 114][CFCO 114] of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Chagrin Falls.

**Section 4.** That in accordance with [Section 113.01][CFCO 113.01] of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Chagrin Falls, public notice of this Ordinance shall be given by posting a copy thereof for not less than fifteen (15) days on the Village Website.

**Section 5.** This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety of the inhabitants of the Village and for the further reason that in order to safely deal with a 3-way intersection and to eliminate parking on Williams Street for the safety of the residents and persons driving motor vehicles within the Village, the 3-way stop signs and No-Parking Zone provisions in Section 1 of this Ordinance need be immediately effective; wherefore, provided it receives the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (⅔) of all members elected to Council, this Ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor, otherwise it shall take effect and be in force after the earliest period allowed by law.
