_Whereas,_ the Ohio General Assembly, in adopting Amended Substitute House Bill
No. 33 in 2023 revised the requirement for public bidding and did not include
certain villages in the provisions that increased the threshold before public
bidding is required from $50,000.00 to $75,000.00; and

_Whereas,_ the Village Council has determined that as a matter of local self
government and efficient, expedient and practical benefits, due to the recent
phenomenon of a lack of interest by companies bidding on public contracts, that
the Village Council shall determine by ordinance the threshold before public
bidding shall be required for public contracts in which the Village of Chagrin
Falls is a party; and

_Whereas,_ this Council finds that it is appropriate to amend the Charter of the
Village of Chagrin Falls to authorize the Village Council to determine, by
ordinance, the threshold before public bidding shall be required; and

_Whereas,_ pursuant to [Article XVIII, Section 9][OC 18.9] of the Constitution
of the State of Ohio and the Charter of the Village of Chagrin Falls, this
Council has the right, by a two-thirds (⅔) majority affirmative vote, to submit
to the voters of the Village of Chagrin Falls, proposed amendments to the
Charter of the Village of Chagrin Falls; and

_Whereas,_ this Council finds and determines that it is in the Village’s best
interest to submit to the electors of the Village of Chagrin Falls a proposed
amendment to the Charter as hereinabove summarized; and

_Whereas,_ this Council chooses the date of March 19, 2024 for the election on

than sixty (60) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days from date of
passage of this Ordinance.
