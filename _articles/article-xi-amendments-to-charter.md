## Section XI-1: Procedure

The Charter may be amended as provided by Article XVIII, Section 9, of the
Constitution of Ohio by the submission of the proposed amendments to the
electors of the Municipality.

If any such amendment is approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon,
it shall become a part of this Charter, except that if two or more inconsistent
proposed amendments on the same subject shall be submitted at the same election,
only the one of such amendments receiving the highest number of affirmative
votes, not less than a majority, shall become a part of this Charter.

## Section XI-2: Charter review

In January, 1966 and each five years thereafter, the Mayor shall appoint,
subject to confirmation by a majority vote of Council, five electors of the
Municipality holding no other office, appointment or employment in the
government of the Municipality, as members of a Charter Review Commission. Such
Commission shall review the Charter, and within five calendar months after such
appointment, recommend to Council such amendments, if any, to this Charter, as
in its judgment are desirable. The Council may by a two-thirds vote of its
members submit to the electors not later than the next succeeding general
election any such proposed amendments. The members appointed to said Commission
shall serve without compensation. Meetings of the Charter Review Commission
shall be open to the public.
