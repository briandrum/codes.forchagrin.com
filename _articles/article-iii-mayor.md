## Section III-1: Term

The Mayor shall have been a resident and a qualified elector of the Municipality
for at least two continuous years prior to the mayoral election and shall

Mayor shall not hold any other public office, except as otherwise provided in
this Charter or by ordinance enacted thereunder, and that of notary public or
membership in the State Militia or reserve corps of the United States.

## Section III-3: Removal

The Council may remove the Mayor for gross misconduct, or malfeasance,
misfeasance or nonfeasance in or disqualification for office, or for the
conviction while in office of a crime involving moral turpitude, or if
adjudicated legally incompetent or for a violation of the oath of office;
provided, however, that such removal shall not take place without the
affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members of Council nor until the Mayor
shall have been notified in writing of the charge at least ten days in advance
of a public hearing upon such charge, and the Mayor or the Mayor's counsel has
been given an opportunity at such hearing to be heard, present evidence, or
examine any witness appearing in support of the charge.

## Section III-4: Absence and vacancy

1. _(a)_ **Absence.** When the Mayor is for any reason unable to perform Mayoral
duties, the President of Council shall become the acting Mayor, and while so
acting shall have and exercise all of the powers of the Mayor, but shall not
thereby cease to be the President of Council. In the event the President of
Council is absent from the Municipality, or for any reason is unable to perform
the duties of acting Mayor, when the Mayor is for any reason unable to perform
Mayoral duties, the President pro tem of Council shall become the acting Mayor,
and while so acting shall have all the powers and duties of the Mayor, but shall
not thereby cease to be President pro tem of Council.\
(Amended 11-4-86)

2. _(b)_ **Vacancy.** If the office of Mayor becomes vacant, the President of
Council shall forthwith become Mayor, except as herein after set forth, and
shall serve through the end of the calendar year of the next general election at
which the office of Mayor can be determined by the electors of the Municipality,
for the unexpired term and the President pro tem shall become the President of
Council. Thereupon, the vacancy in Council shall first be filled in the manner
provided in Section 6 of Article IV, and then a new President pro tem shall be
chosen by Council. If the President of Council declines to serve as Mayor,
Council shall then appoint by majority vote one (1) Council member as Mayor to
serve until the end of the calendar year in which the next general election will
be held and the election of Mayor for the balance of the unexpired term can be
decided by the electors of the Municipality. If a Mayor-elect fails to qualify
for office, a vacancy shall be deemed to exist and the President of Council
elected at the organization meeting following such regular Municipal election
shall become Mayor for that portion of the term as provided above. The election
for Mayor for the balance of the remaining term, when the office of Mayor
becomes vacant, shall be held at the next general election which is more than
one hundred twenty (120) days after the office of Mayor becomes vacant.\
(Amended 11-2-21)

    8. _(8)_ Shall have custody of the seal of the Municipality and may affix it

    Charter, or by any ordinance or resolution of the Council or by the laws of
    the State of Ohio.

Subject to the provisions of this Charter and the provisions of the civil

the Mayor shall have the power to appoint, promote, discipline, transfer,

before Council.

3. _(c)_ **Veto Powers.** Every ordinance or resolution adopted by Council shall
be signed by the President of Council or other presiding officer, attested by
the Clerk of Council and presented promptly to the Mayor. If the Mayor approves
such ordinance or resolution, it shall be signed and returned to the Clerk of
Council within ten days after its adoption by Council, but if the Mayor does not
approve it, it shall be returned to Council within said ten days with the
Mayor's written objections by delivery to the Clerk of Council, which objections
shall be entered in full on the journal of the Council. If the Mayor does not
sign or so return an ordinance or resolution within said ten-day period, it
shall take effect in the same manner as if the Mayor had signed it. The Mayor
may approve or disapprove the whole or any item of an ordinance or resolution
appropriating money, but otherwise the Mayor's approval or disapproval shall be
addressed to the entire ordinance or resolution. When the Mayor has disapproved
an ordinance or resolution, or a part or item thereof as herein provided, the
Council shall not later than its next regular meeting, proceed to reconsider it,
and if upon reconsideration the ordinance or resolution or part or item thereof
disapproved by the Mayor be approved by the affirmative vote of at least
two-thirds of the members of Council, it shall then take effect without the
signature of the Mayor in the same manner as if the Mayor had signed it. In all
such cases, the votes shall be taken by yeas and nays and entered upon the
journal.

4. _(d)_ **Judicial Powers.** The Mayor shall have all the judicial powers
granted from time to time by the general laws of the State of Ohio to mayors of
municipalities of the class of this Municipality.\
