accordance with the approved preliminary plan, and any variances granted by the
Board.

fifteen (15) days before the hearing date, to owners of property within and

property within three hundred (300) feet of the location of the property
involved in the application request. The addresses of such owners shall be
obtained from the addresses appearing on the County Auditor’s tax list or the

invalidate subsequent action. If questions arise at the hearing regarding the
adequacy of notice, the decision- making body shall make a finding as to
whether there was substantial compliance with the notice requirements of this

of the Municipality document the publication or mailing of required notices, it
shall be presumed that notice of a public hearing was given as required by this
