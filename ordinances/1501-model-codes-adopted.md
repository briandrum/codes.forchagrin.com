Association.

The normal manual control for actuation shall be located so as to be
conveniently and easily accessible at all times, including at the time of fire.
This control shall cause the complete system to operate in its normal fashion.

All hazards venting through a common duct are to be protected
simultaneously. Actuation of the system must automatically close dampers, shut
off forced ventilating fans and shut off the master fuel valve or power switch
to all cooking equipment associated with the hood; these must be of the type
that require manual resetting. Systems installed in any building with its alarm
system connected directly into the Fire Department alarm system, when
available, shall also be connected into this circuit.

Systems not connected to the Fire Department alarm system shall have a four-
inch alarm bell installed so as to sound on the actuation of the extinguishing
system.

The actuation switch to this bell shall be enclosed within a locked box and
all keys to such box shall be left with the Fire Department.

Plans and specifications shall be submitted to the Bureau of Fire
Prevention, the Fire Chief and the Ohio Inspection Bureau, for approval before
installation may proceed.

Automatic fire extinguishing systems shall be inspected and full-flow tested
with the  extinguishing agent which the system is designed for, before
acceptance and annually there after, by the manufacturer or his authorized
agent, and a report of its test and inspection sent to the Bureau of Fire
Prevention. All testing shall be done under the direct supervision of the
Bureau of Fire Prevention. A discharge of twenty percent of the extinguishing
agent shall be used in the annual test.

If upon inspection by the Bureau of Fire Prevention any such cooking
appliances are found not to be protected by an automatic extinguishing system
as required by this section, the Fire Chief shall order the owner, tenant or
operator of such facilities to submit plans and specifications to the Bureau of
Fire Prevention for the installation of such system and shall order the
installation of such system according to approved plans. Such plans and
specifications shall be submitted within six months of receipt of such order
and the installation of the system shall be completed within one year of
receipt of such order, except that the Fire Chief may grant an extension of
such time limits for delays caused by factors beyond the control of the person
