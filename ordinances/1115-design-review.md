## 1115.01   Intent

     In order to maintain and enhance the distinctive character of the
Municipality these regulations are established to achieve, among others, the
following objectives:

1. _(a)_ To preserve and protect the public health, safety and welfare by
maintaining the high character of community development;
2. _(b)_ To protect the real estate within the Municipality from impairment or
destruction of value by regulating, according to proper architectural
principles, the design, use of materials, finished grade lines and orientation
of all new buildings, signs and structures, hereafter erected and the moving,
alteration, improvement, repair, addition, or demolition of the exterior of all
existing buildings; and
3. _(c)_ To consider the historical and architectural nature of existing
buildings, signs and structures within the Municipality and the compatibility
of proposed changes or proposed new buildings, signs and structures with such
existing buildings, signs and structures.   
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1115.02   Applicability and limitations

1. _(a)_ Applicability. No building or other structure in the Municipality
shall be erected, altered in exterior construction or appearance, enlarged,
moved or demolished unless such action complies with the provisions of this
chapter. The painting of buildings and structures shall not be governed by
these regulations nor buildings considered Historic that are regulated under
Chapter 1146.
2. _(b)_ Limitation.  In administering these provisions, it is not intended to
insist that new construction or alterations copy either existing architectural
styles or existing decorative detail. Further, the Architectural Board of
Review shall not be overly restrictive in its judgment of structures not highly
visible from a public street or public property, except where such construction
or alteration would materially and adversely affect another property.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1115.03   Administrative procedures

The following procedures are established to govern the processing of
applications for building permits and other municipal authorizations in
accordance with the regulations of this chapter.

1. _(a)_ Mandatory Referral.  As directed by Section 1109.05(b)(1), all requests for building permits shall first be referred to the
Architectural Board of Review for a determination of compliance with the
provisions of the Planning and Zoning Code.
2. _(b)_ Grade. Where an applicant for a building permit proposes to change the
existing grade of a lot by more than three (3) inches, the Architectural Board
of Review shall review such change  to ensure that the proposed building
elevations and site grading are compatible with contiguous property and that
the proposed building or structure meets the standards set forth in Section 1115.04.
3. _(c)_ Conformance. Construction shall be in conformance with an approved
Final Plan. No material changes shall be made to an approved Final Plan prior
to or during construction. If the Administrator determines that any action has
caused a material change to an approved Final Plan, the applicant plan shall be
referred back to the Architectural Board of Review for consideration of such
change, All work related to the Final Plan shall cease and the Administrator
shall suspend any permit issued in reliance upon such approval until the change
in the Final Plan is finally resolved.
4. _(d)_ Appeal.  An appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be made in
accordance with Chapter 1111 of the Planning and Zoning Code.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1115.04   Standards of review

     The Architectural Board of Review has the authority to regulate, according
to proper architectural principles, the design, use of materials, finished
grade lines and orientation of new construction, and to make recommendations to
the applicant regarding the proposed design. In conducting its review, the
Architectural Board of Review shall:

1. _(a)_ Consider and take cognizance of the development of adjacent,
contiguous, and neighboring properties for the purpose of achieving safe,
harmonious, and integrated development of related properties;
2. _(b)_ Consider the Village of Chagrin Falls Design Guidelines adopted by
the  Council on October 10, 2005, and as may thereafter be amended, as well as
design standards of Section 1115.07;
3. _(c)_ Consider the relationship of each design element to the building or
structure as a whole;
4. _(d)_ Consider the potential for the design, by virtue of its location, to
materially and adversely impact another building or property; and
5. _(e)_ State reasons to support its decision as required by Section 1109.05((b)(1)(E) of the Planning and Zoning Code.   
(Ord.  2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1115.05   Demolition and moving

     The demolition or moving of a building or structure shall be permitted
only after the applicant has obtained all permits required to be issued by the
Planning and Zoning Code and other applicable ordinances of the Municipality.
The applicant shall obtain preliminary and final approval from the
Architectural Board of Review for the building or structure that is to replace
it.

reconstruction, alteration  or demolition of a structure or feature which has
been ordered by the Administrator upon certification of an unsafe condition
constituting an emergency.
