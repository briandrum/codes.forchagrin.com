## 1153.01   Intent

     In addition to the applicable provisions of the intent stated in Section 1105.03, it is the intent of these regulations to provide for the placement of

of solar energy systems;
2. _(b)_ To require solar energy systems to meet reasonable standards that will
protect the public health, safety, and welfare while preserving the enjoyment
of private property;
3. _(c)_ To minimize the adverse impacts of solar energy systems on contiguous
properties and on the aesthetic quality of the Municipality; and, 
4. _(d)_ To promote orderly land use, and development while allowing the safe,
effective, and efficient use of solar energy systems.   
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1153.02   Definitions

1. _(a)_ "Abandonment" means the discontinued use of the solar energy
generation system in whole or part.

work in combination to convert solar energy to electrical power.   
3. _(c)_ "Solar cell" means the basic photovoltaic device that generates
electricity when exposed to light.
4. _(d)_ "Solar energy system" means the photovoltaic cells and related
accessories that are designed to convert solar energy into electrical energy;
or a system consisting of solar thermal collectors, parabolic reflectors, or
similar structures that are designed to harness solar energy for use as thermal
energy for heating water or air and may include battery storage systems.
5. _(e)_ "Solar panel" means any device used for collecting solar energy and
converting it to electrical power.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

training, North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP)
certification and licensure as may be required for the installation of solar
energy systems.
6. _(f)_ Certification by a licensed structural engineer that the roof of the
building is designed to handle all structural loads including those imposed by
the proposed solar panel system.
7. _(g)_ Evidence that the local public electric utility company approves the
applicant’s intent to install an interconnected customer-owned system if the
proposed system is to interconnect to a local utility grid.

## 1153.05   General requirements

1. _(a)_ Solar energy systems shall be permitted as accessory to a main use or
building located on the same lot or parcel. Such facilities shall be designed,
installed, or constructed to provide electrical power to be primarily consumed
by the main use or building to which they are accessory.
   
2. _(b)_ The Architectural Board of Review shall review solar energy systems
applications for compliance with the Building Code, general design standards,
and design standards established in this Planning and Zoning Code.
3. _(c)_ Solar panels shall be placed on the roof of a building in accordance
with the following:
    1. _(1)_ Solar panels shall not be visible from any street or sidewalk at
the front elevation of the property unless approved in accordance with
procedures set forth in subsection (d) herein.
    2. _(2)_ Solar panels shall not extend beyond the edge of the roof.
    3. _(3)_ For pitched roofs (sloped in excess of three (3) inches per foot),
solar panels shall be placed parallel to the plane of pitched roof and shall be
ten (10) inches or less above the surface of the roof when measured to the top
of the solar panel.
    4. _(4)_ For low slope (pitches less than three (3) inches per foot) and
flat roofs, the Architectural Board of Review may approve solar panels of
alternative heights and configurations as appropriate for such roof.
4. _(d)_ The Architectural Board of Review may approve the placement of solar
panels in roof locations that are visible from any street or sidewalk, when the
applicant has demonstrated to the Architectural Board of Review that:
    1. _(1)_ The alternative location is necessary to optimize system
functionality;
    2. _(2)_ The proposed panel(s) and their location(s) are designed to
minimize any adverse impacts to the neighborhood; and/or,
    3. _(3)_ The size and location of any structure is the minimum necessary to
serve the needs of the building(s) on the property.
5. _(e)_ When locating a solar panel, it is the property owner’s responsibility
to consider current and future development, growth of trees and vegetation, and
other obstructions that might interfere with solar access. Nothing in this
section shall prohibit the owner of the solar energy system from requesting or
obtaining a solar access easement from any person.
6. _(f)_ Solar access easements shall be in compliance with Ohio R.C. 5301.63
which sets forth the requirements for solar access. In order to ensure adequate
access of solar energy collection devices to sunlight, any person may grant a
solar access easement. Such easements shall be in writing and subject to the
same conveyance and recording requirements as other easements. Any instrument
creating a solar easement shall be recorded in the Cuyahoga County Recorder’s
Office.
7. _(g)_ Solar panels and related equipment shall be located, oriented or

practicable glare from solar panels to not be directed at any other person,
building or public right of way.
8. _(h)_ Solar panels shall be uniform in appearance and color, and to the
extent practicable, match the design and color of the roof on which the panels
will be placed.
9. _(i)_ Accessory components shall be located either within a building, or
within a screened enclosure behind the main building, or are hidden from view
behind the parapet wall of buildings with flat roofs.
