## 751.01   Removal in residence areas; restoration

No person shall remove topsoil, loam, sand, gravel, rock, stone, clay or
other similar substance from land located in any area or place zoned for
residence use only within the Municipality However, this prohibition does not
apply to excavation or removal of material for a basement or foundation for any
proposed building for which a building permit has been issued and is in force
and effect. If such building is not commenced and carried forward, any
excavation or removal made preparatory thereto for a basement or foundation
shall be filled up and replanted, and any soil or material excavated for such
basement or foundation shall not be left piled or stored on the premises more
than three months after such excavation, unless properly graded to an approved
grade.  
(Ord. 1956-381. Passed 8-13-56.)

## 751.02   Issuance of permit

The Building Inspector (i.e. the Chief Administrative Officer) may issue a
permit to remove topsoil and substances enumerated in Section 751.01 if he finds that all of the conditions of this chapter will be or have
been complied with and if he finds that no nuisance or hazard to person or
property will be created by such operation.  
(Ord. 1956-381. Passed 8-13-56.)

## 751.03   Application for permit; fee

Any person desiring to remove topsoil, loam, sand, gravel, rock, stone, clay
or other similar substance from any area not zoned exclusively for residence
use shall first make application to and obtain a permit from the Building
Inspector. Such application shall be in writing, giving the name and address of
the applicant and the owner of the property involved, a description of the
property, the method of removal to be employed, the time within which such work
is to be commenced and completed, the depth to which it is proposed that the
material be removed and the steps to be taken toward restoration and ultimate
use of the land. The applicant for such permit shall deposit with the Building
Inspector as the cost of such permit and necessary inspections by the
Inspector, an amount equal to twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each acre-foot
of soil or material to be removed.  
(Ord. 1956-381. Passed 8-13-56; Ord. 1990-79. Passed 10-8-90.)

## 751.04   Bond required

Before issuing a permit to remove soil, the applicant shall post a bond in
the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) in favor of the Municipality,
conditioned upon the performance of the work authorized by the permit in
accordance with this chapter and the terms of such permit, signed by the
applicant and a good and satisfactory corporate surety.  
(Ord. 1956-381. Passed 8-13-56.)

## 751.05   Natural drainage altered; regrading; reseeding

No such removal of soil or other substances will be permitted if such
removal would change or alter the natural drainage from the land affected or
result in the collection of stagnant water. Within six months from the
completion of such operation, the area affected shall be regraded to contours
and grades as natural and level as possible, so as to remove all abrupt breaks
or banks, piles or mounds in the topography, and the affected area shall be
reseeded at the applicant’s expense with rye grass or its equivalent at the
rate of twenty-five pounds per acre, or sweet clover or its equivalent at the
rate of twelve pounds per acre.  
(Ord. 1956-381. Passed 8-13-56.)

electrical, pneumatically, hydraulically powered or battery operated apparatus
used in connection with any construction or demolition activity between the
hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. from Monday to Saturday, inclusive.  No such
activity or operation shall be performed on Sundays or holidays.  Trucks or
other vehicles shall not be so loaded with topsoil or other materials as to
result in or cause spilling of soil or materials on the streets.
