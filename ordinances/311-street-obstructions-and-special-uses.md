## 311.02   Parades and assemblages

<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. _(a)_ No person, group of persons or organization shall conduct or
participate in any parade, assemblage or procession other than a funeral
procession upon any street or highway, or block off any street or highway area,
without first obtaining a permit from the Police Chief.  
Applications for such permits shall be made on such forms as may be
prescribed and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to a
fair determination of whether a permit should be issued. Applications shall be
filed not less than five days before the time intended for such parade,
procession or assemblage.  
The permit may be refused or cancelled if:
    1. _(1)_ The time, place, size or conduct of the parade including the
assembly areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere with the public
convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
    2. _(2)_ The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of
police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the
Municipality.
    3. _(3)_ The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably
interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
    4. _(4)_ The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for
which a permit has been issued.
    5. _(5)_ The information contained in the application is found to be false,
misleading or incomplete in any material detail.
    6. _(6)_ An emergency such as a fire or storm would prevent the proper
conduct of the parade.  
The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe reasonable
conditions, including the hours, the place of assembly and of dispersal, the
route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions thereof which
may be used or occupied.
2. _(b)_ Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

person shall use  any of the public roads, streets, highways or alleys of the

skating, skiing or other similar sport,  unless such road, street, highway or
alley has first been designated by the Chief of  Police for such use, for such
days or parts of days as shall be designated by the Chief  of Police. The Chief
of Police, in designating any road, street, highway or alley for  such

warnings  and barriers to be erected so as to make the same reasonably safe for
recreational  purposes without unduly inconveniencing the public in its use of
thoroughfares.

of public  safety, all police officers are authorized to close off streets or

established.
