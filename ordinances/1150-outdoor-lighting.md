## 1150.01   Purpose and intent

     It is the intent of this Planning and Zoning Code to preserve, protect,
and enhance the lawful nighttime use and enjoyment of any and all property
through the use of appropriate lighting practices and systems. Such individual
fixtures and lighting systems shall be designed, constructed, and installed to
(i) control glare, (ii) prevent light trespass, (iii) minimize obtrusive light,
and (iv) conserve energy while maintaining safety, security and productivity.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1150.02   Definitions

1. _(a)_ Cut-off Angle (of a luminaire) - the angle, measured up from the
nadir, between the vertical axis and the first line of site at which the bare
source is not visible.
2. _(b)_ Director Light - light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the
reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of
a luminaire.
3. _(c)_ Foot Candle - a unit of illuminance equal to one lumen per square foot
or 10.76 Lux.
4. _(d)_ Flood or Spotlight - any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a
reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam
in a particular direction.
5. _(e)_ Full Cut-off or Fully-Shielded Luminaire - a luminaire constructed or
shielded in such a manner that all light emitted by the luminaire, either
directly from the lamp or indirectly from the luminaire, is projected below the
horizontal plane through the luminaire’s lowest light emitting part as
certified by the manufacturer.
6. _(f)_ Glare - light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough
to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss of visual performance and visibility.
7. _(g)_ HID Light Source - means a lamp which utilizes a small gas arc
discharge or "high intensity discharge" as the light emitter. Examples of HID
light sources are mercury, metal halide and high-pressure sodium lamps.
8. _(h)_ Light Trespass- the unwanted shining of direct light produced by a
luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located, also
meaning light that is of an intrusive and objectionable nature.
9. _(i)_ Lumen - the unit measure of light flux or light output from lamps and
luminaires.
10. _(j)_ Luminaire - a complete lighting unit typically consisting of all
electrical and mechanical parts necessary for operation including a lamp,
ballast (in the case of discharge lamps), optical assembly and enclosure.
11. _(k)_ Lux - the SI unit of illuminance. One lux is one (1) lumen per square
meter and approximately 0.1 foot-candles.
12. _(l)_ Maximum Mean Average Lux - the maximum average lux level on a surface
based upon the average lumen output of a lamp over its life. Average lumen
output over the life of the lamp is typically about 75% of new lamp lumen
output.
13. _(m)_ Temporary Outdoor Lighting - lighting that is applied temporarily for
construction, safety, seasonal events, or public events.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1150.03   General requirements

1. _(a)_ Outdoor lighting fixtures installed in all zoning districts other than
the Parks, Conservation and all residential  districts, after the effective
date of this Chapter 1150, shall comply with the following:
    1. _(1)_ Lighting Plans. Full lighting plans shall be required prior to
the installation of any lighting improvements or fixtures. Lighting plans shall
show the following:
        1. _(A)_   The location and height above grade of the luminaires.
        2. _(B)_   The wattage and type of each light source such as incandescent,
fluorescent, metal halide, etc.

lantern, globe, floodlight, full-cutoff area luminaire, wall pack, downlight,
etc.
        4. _(D)_   Calculated or manufacturer-rated numerical values of total
light output (lumens) of the luminaire or luminaires and the light output above
a horizontal plane through the optical center of the luminaire if the light
output per lamp is greater than allowed by this regulation.
        5. _(E)_   A 2-D or 3-D photometric model that quantifies calculated light
output on the property and demonstrates compliance with the regulation.
        6. _(F)_   Building walls to be illuminated by wall mounted or facade-
mounted luminaires including relevant building elevations showing the location
of the luminaires, their aiming direction and aiming angle (if directional),
the portions of the building walls to be illuminated, and their color.
    2. _(2)_ Where used for safety or security purposes, only fully shielded
luminaires shall be utilized.
    3. _(3)_ The cut-off angle or placement of all luminaires will be such
that the level of lighting shall not exceed 11 1ux at any property line
measured by meter line of sight to any luminaire. Other than light incidental
to fully shielded lighting, no direct light will be allowed to trespass onto
other properties.
    4. _(4)_ Island canopy ceiling fixtures shall be recessed so that direct
light cannot radiate  onto adjacent properties or roadways.
    5. _(5)_ With the exception of flag lighting, ground level signs, any
decorative lighting mounted as shielded sconces (emitting a maximum of 3,000
lumens each) on building side walls, no lighting may be pointed in an upward
direction.
    6. _(6)_ All non-residential  lighting will be designed to provide
average lux levels at ground level in keeping with the recommended averages
published in RP-33 Lighting for Exterior Environments and RP-20 Light for
Parking Facilities by the IESNA (Illuminating Engineering Society of North
America), and all institutional, industrial and business district lighting will
be designed to achieve no more than a maximum mean average equal to 200% of
recommended averages or maximums. Average lux levels in excess of 300% of
recommended averages or maximum at ground level will be in non-conformance with
this Chapter. Parking lot lighting shall not exceed more than a maximum mean
average of 50 lux at ground level.
    7. _(7)_ All outdoor light pole fixtures shall not be taller than the
