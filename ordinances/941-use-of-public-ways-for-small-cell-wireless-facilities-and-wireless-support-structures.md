timeframe for a Type 3 Application shall be 90 days.
2. _(b)_ Applications shall be reviewed for completeness. If the Application is
incomplete, then the Applicant will be notified of the insufficiency, and the
timeframes set forth in subsection (a) shall be tolled until the Application is
made complete, as described below:
    1. _(1)_ To toll the time period for incompleteness, the Village must
provide written notice to the Applicant, specifically identifying all missing
documents or information, within thirty (30) days after receiving the
Application; except that where an Applicant has indicated that the  Application
is for a Small Wireless Facility, or a Wireless Support Structure upon which a

within ten (10) days after receiving the Application.
        1. _(A)_ In the case of a proper and timely initial written notice of
incompleteness provided concerning an Application involving a Small Wireless
Facility pursuant to subsection (b)(1), the time period set forth in subsection
(a) shall be deemed never to have started running at all until Applicant
provides a supplemental submission.
    2. _(2)_ The time period set forth in subsection (a) will begin to run again
when the Applicant provides a supplemental submission in response to the
Village’s notice of incompleteness, but may be tolled again if the Village
notifies the applicant in writing, within ten (10) days of receiving a
supplemental submission, that the Application remains incomplete and identifies
which items specified in the original notice of incompleteness are still
missing. Timely notice by the Village of the deficiencies in a supplemental
submission tolls the time period set forth in subsection (a) until the
Applicant supplies the specified information.
3. _(c)_ The timeframes set out in subsection (a) may also be tolled by mutual
agreement between the Applicant and the Village. The timeframes in subsections
(a)(2) and (a)(3) may also be tolled as follows, except that where an Applicant
has indicated that the Application is for a Small Wireless Facility, the
provisions of subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) below do not apply:
    1. _(1)_ If the Village receives between fifteen (15) and thirty (30)
applications in a thirty (30) day period, then the Village may toll the
evaluation for an additional twenty (20) days.
    2. _(2)_ If the Village receives more than thirty (30) applications in a
thirty (30) day period, then the Village may toll the evaluation for an
additional fifteen (15) days for every fifteen (15) applications received.
    3. _(3)_ By mutual agreement between the Applicant and the Village.
    4. _(4)_ When an Applicant submits an underground area waiver pursuant to
Section 943.13(d) of the Codified Ordinances, in which case the Village may toll the
evaluation for an additional fourteen (14) days.
4. _(d)_ If two Applicants request to Collocate on the same Wireless Support
Structure or two Wireless Support Structures are proposed within a distance
that would violate the spacing requirements set forth in Section 941.16, then the Chief Administrative Officer may resolve the conflict in any
reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner.
5. _(e)_ If a request for consent is denied, the Village shall provide, in
writing, its reasons for denying the request, supported by substantial,
competent evidence. The denial of consent shall not unreasonably discriminate
against the Applicant. Grounds for denying an Application may include, but are
not limited to:
    1. _(1)_ Failure to provide information required under Section 941.07;
    2. _(2)_ Failure to comply with Design Guidelines set forth in Chapter 943;
    3. _(3)_ Failure to provide financial surety pursuant to Section 941.15;
    4. _(4)_ Failure to remove abandoned Facilities as required under Section 941.12;

4. _(d)_ A Small Cell Use Permit shall not be renewed if the Facilities
Operator or the Facilities are not in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations.
5. _(e)_ Pursuant to O.R.C. Section 4939.0314(E), a Small Cell Use Permit shall
be deemed terminated if the Facilities Operator has not completed construction
of the Facilities or has failed to attach Small Cell Equipment to a Wireless
Support Structure within 180 days of issuance of the permit, unless the delay
is caused by:
    1. _(1)_ Make-ready work for a municipally-owned Wireless Support Structure;
or
    2. _(2)_ Due to the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the
site, provided that the Operator has made a request for commercial power or
backhaul services within sixty days after the Small Cell Use Permit was
granted.  
If the additional time to complete the installation exceeds three hundred
sixty days (360) after the issuance of the permit, then the permit shall be
deemed terminated regardless of the cause of the delay.
6. _(f)_ A Small Cell Use Permit for a new Wireless Support Structure shall be
deemed terminated if the Facilities Operator fails to attach Small Cell
Equipment to the new Wireless Support Structure within one hundred eighty (180)
days of issuance of the Small Cell Use Permit.
7. _(g)_ If the Facilities Operator fails to remit the annual attachment fee
required pursuant to Section 941.10, then the Small Cell Use Permit will expire on the ninetieth (90th) day
from the date the annual attachment fee was due.
8. _(h)_ A Small Cell Use Permit may be terminated by the Facilities Operator
at any time upon service of sixty (60) days written notice to the Village.

Way shall register with the Village each calendar year between January 1 and
January 31 on a form provided by the Village. The form will allow the
Facilities Operator to indicate when there is no change in the information
required, and when such indication is submitted, previously provided
information will be considered current and will be relied upon. Facilities
Operators who obtain consent to occupy the Right-of-Way after September 30 of
any year need not file an Annual Registration for next calendar year.
2. _(b)_ The purpose of registration under this Section is to:
    1. _(1)_ Compile, update and supplement the Village’s database so that the
Village has accurate and current information concerning the Facilities
Operators that own or operate Facilities in the Village/Village’s public Right-
of-Way;
    2. _(2)_ Assist the Village in monitoring the usage of the public Right-of-
Way in order to ensure that the public receives the maximum possible benefit

the insurance, indemnity and financial surety requirements pursuant to this
Chapter.
        4. _(iv)_ Such other information as the Chief Administrative Officer may
reasonably require.
4. _(d)_ In addition to the annual registration requirement, each Facilities
Operator shall keep all required registration information current at all times
and shall provide the Village with notice of changes to the required
information within fifteen (15) days following the date on which the Facilities
Operator has notice of the need for such change.  
(Ord. 2019-10. Passed 1-14-19.)
