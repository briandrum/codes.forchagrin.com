## 1161.05   Design standards

1. _(a)_ Design Standards Statement. The provisions of this chapter shall
control the manner in which streets, lots and other elements of a subdivision
are arranged on the land. These planning controls shall insure convenient and
safe streets, creation of usable lots, provision of space for public utilities
and reservation of land for open spaces.
2. _(b)_ Design Review. The Planning and Zoning Commission has responsibility
for reviewing the design of each future subdivision early in its design
development. The Commission shall insure that all of the requirements in this
chapter are met.
3. _(c)_ Conformity to Zoning Districts. Individual lot and building
specifications shall be in accordance with the zoning districts and regulations
listed in Chapter 1119 to Chapter 1139, inclusive.
4. _(d)_ Physical Considerations.
    1. _(1)_ Natural land use. Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage
of the topography of the land, to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil, and to preserve such
natural features as watercourses, unusual rock formations, large trees, sites
of historical significance and other assets which if preserved will add
attractiveness and value to the subdivision and the community.
    2. _(2)_ Suitability of land. The Planning and Zoning Commission, with the
advice of the Village Engineer, shall review and determine if land proposed to
be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding,
inadequate drainage, topography, inadequate water supply, seasonal high water
table limitations, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
the features or conditions which will be hazardous to the safety, health and
general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or
its surrounding area.
5. _(e)_ Street Design. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade,
construction and location of all streets shall conform to the standards and
specifications of the Village Engineer and to Chapters
901 to 905. They shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned
streets, so that the entire area can be served with a coordinated public street
system. The width of the right of way should be provided so that all
underground utilities can be located outside of pavement areas.
6. _(f)_ Street Classification.
    1. _(1)_ Arterial streets. Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned
for continuation of movement of traffic between points of heavy traffic
generation and from one section of the community to another. They shall
contain as few intersections with minor streets as possible.
    2. _(2)_ Local streets. Local streets shall provide direct and full access
to each lot and shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged. The street system shall be so designed that all proposed streets
shall be in general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous
development of the entire neighborhood. The streets shall be extended to the
boundaries of the tract to be recorded unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, such extension is not necessary nor desirable for the coordination
of the layout of the subdivision with the development of adjacent tracts. 
Dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs shall be approved only when necessitated by
topography or other physical conditions or where they are appropriate for the
type of development contemplated.
         Parallel streets may be required along an existing or proposed major
arterial thoroughfare to provide access to lots along such major arterial
thoroughfares.
    3. _(3)_ Street right-of-way widths and grades.
 
                                            Minimum  Grades
                                          Right-of-Wayby Percent
Classification                          Width in Feet  Maximum Minimum
Major arterial thoroughfare             60*            6       0.5
Collector, commercial and local streets 60*            12      0.5
*  Indicates a minimum ten-foot easement to be adjacent to the proposed
right-of-way lines on both sides of the streets.
    4. _(4)_ Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where there
is an existing half street adjacent to the subdivision, in which case the
remaining half of the street shall be platted.
    5. _(5)_ Cul-de-sac and dead-end streets. Streets designed to be permanent
cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 750 feet and shall be provided at the
closed end with a turnaround having an outside pavement radius of at least 37.5
feet and a street right-of-way line radius of at least 62.5 feet with a paving
diameter of ninety feet.
         If a cul-de-sac is of a temporary nature and a future extension into
adjacent land is anticipated, then such turning circle beyond the normal street
width shall be in the nature of an easement. Such easements shall be
automatically vacated to abutting property owners when the dead-end street is
legally extended into adjacent land.
    6. _(6)_ Corner radii. Property lines at street intersections shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than twenty-five feet or as required by the
Village Engineer.
    7. _(7)_ Horizontal curves. Angles in the alignment of street lines shall
be connected by a curve with a radius on the centerline of not less than 300
feet for local streets, 800 feet for collector streets and 1,200 feet for major
arterial thoroughfares. Between reverse curves there shall be a tangent at
least 100 feet long on major arterial thoroughfares.
    8. _(8)_ Intersections. Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle of less than seventy degrees. In no event shall an intersection
containing streets in excess of four legs be considered unless specifically
approved by the Planning Commission.
    9. _(9)_ Street centerline offsets (jogs). Street jogs with centerline
offsets shall be prohibited unless specifically approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and Village Engineer.
7. _(g)_ Easements.
    1. _(1)_ Utility easements. Adequate easements along rear or side lot lines
shall be provided for utilities where necessary. A ten-foot easement on each
front lot line for utilities is required.
    2. _(2)_ Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage
way, a storm sewer or drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines
of such drainage way shall be provided. The easement shall be a minimum of
twenty feet or as the Village Engineer may require.
    3. _(3)_ Utility lines. All utility lines including electric, telephone and
cable television shall be located underground wherever possible.
8. _(h)_ Lots.
    1. _(1)_ Zoning conformance. The lot size, width, depth and the minimum
building setback lines shall meet at a minimum the existing Zoning Regulations,
except where the Commission and Village Engineer determine the Hillside
Protection Regulations apply.
    2. _(2)_ Access to public streets. The subdividing of land whether as major
or minor subdivision, shall provide each lot with the required frontage for the
district in which it is zoned (fifty, sixty or 100 feet of continuous
frontage). For lots which front on a curved street segment, the minimum street
frontage required herein shall be reduced in proportion to the degree of
curvature. The minimum permitted street frontage for such lots shall be that
distance which results from side lot lines drawn as radials of the circle(s)
formed from the front lot line. This standard may be reduced by the Planning
and Zoning Commission for lots fronting on a permanent cul-de-sac.
    3. _(3)_ Lot lines. Lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or
radial to street lines. Lot lines should follow Municipal boundary lines
rather than across them.
    4. _(4)_ Minimum lot depth. No lot depth shall exceed four and one-half
times the lot width or less than one and one-half times the width unless
otherwise approved by the Commission. The lot width shall be measured at the
minimum building setback line.
    5. _(5)_ Double frontage lot. A double frontage lot shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from major
arteries or specific disadvantages of topography.
9. _(i)_ Public Sites and Open Space. The developer is encouraged to give
consideration to preserving outstanding natural features such as scenic spots,
water bodies or groves of trees.
10. _(j)_ Flood Areas and Storm Drain Sewers. In order to protect the health,
safety and general welfare of the people, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall reject any proposed subdivision located in an area subject to a hundred
year flood as found in the Flood Insurance Rate Maps. If the subdivision is
located in an area having poor drainage or other adverse physical
characteristics, the Commission may approve the subdivision based on the advice
of the Village Engineer, provided the subdivider agrees to perform such
improvements as will render the area safe for the intended use. In lieu of
improvements, the subdivider shall furnish a surety or certified check covering
the cost of the required improvements.
