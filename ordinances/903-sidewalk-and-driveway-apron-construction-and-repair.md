<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. {% comment -%} (a) {%- endcomment -%} Every improved lot in the Village shall, in conjunction with an
application for a building permit for a new main building, have a sidewalk
across the entire frontage of the lot and, on corner lots or through lots, each
improved lot shall provide sidewalks across both frontages.  Sidewalks shall be
located and constructed in accordance with this chapter, any other applicable
Codified Ordinances, and any standards established by the Village Engineer. 
Sidewalks shall be maintained in accordance with Section 903.03 and any other applicable Codified Ordinances.
2. {% comment -%} (b) {%- endcomment -%} The Chief Administrative Officer is authorized to grant an exception
to the location and construction requirements, upon receipt of a written
application for exception by the property owner. The Chief Administrative
Officer, in deciding whether to grant an exception, shall consider the
recommendation of the Village Engineer, the unique physical characteristics of
the property, the presence of sidewalks in the surrounding area, the
availability of alternative means of pedestrian access, and any other factors
deemed relevant by the Chief Administrative Officer.  Any person aggrieved by
the decision or action of the Chief Administrative Officer may appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals within 10 days of such official action.  Such an appeal
shall be made in conformity with Chapter 1111.  Written notice of the appeal shall be filed with the Chief
Administrative Officer.
3. {% comment -%} (c) {%- endcomment -%} Any street or part of a street with existing single-family residences
not having sidewalks, as of the effective date of this section, shall not be
required to construct sidewalks until further order of Council.
4. {% comment -%} (d) {%- endcomment -%} Before any certificate of occupancy is issued for any new building, a
sidewalk shall be constructed and installed in accordance with this section. 
If the Chief Administrative Officer, upon recommendation of the Building
Inspector, determines that compliance is not possible due to weather
conditions, the Chief Administrative Officer is authorized to require the
applicant for the certificate of occupancy to submit a cash bond with the
Village for the cost of constructing the required sidewalk.  Such bond shall be
deposited with the Finance Director, and the Building Inspector shall direct
the property owner to construct and install the required sidewalk at the
earliest time that weather conditions permit.  If the property owner constructs
the sidewalk in conformance with all requirements, the Village shall return the
cash bond.  In the event that the property owner fails to comply with the order
of the Building Inspector, after thirty days written notice, the Village may
use the cash bond to construct the sidewalk.  If any balance remains after the
Village constructs the sidewalk, it shall be returned to the property owner. 
If the amount of the bond is insufficient, the Building Inspector shall give
thirty days written notice to the property owner to pay the outstanding
balance.  If the property owner fails to do so, the unpaid sum shall be
referred to collection.

## 903.02   Construction specifications

All sidewalks and driveway aprons hereafter constructed, reconstructed,
replaced, altered or repaired in dedicated streets within the corporate limits
of the Municipality shall conform to the following requirements. For the
purpose of this chapter, all paved  areas between the curb line and the
property line in dedicated streets shall be considered as sidewalk or driveway
aprons.

<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. {% comment -%} (a) {%- endcomment -%} Alignment. The property edge of sidewalks shall be laid a minimum of
six inches off the property line abutting and fronting upon the street.
2. {% comment -%} (b) {%- endcomment -%} Grades. The grade of sidewalks and driveways shall have a slope
towards the curb of one-fourth inch per foot from the property line to the
established grade of the top of the curb, except that driveway aprons may have
a steeper slope in the tree lawn or curb lawn area in order to meet the lowered
curb at the driveway apron. All paved or unpaved tree lawns or curb lawns shall
slope uniformly from the grade at the edge of the sidewalk nearest to the curb
to the grade at the top of the curb.
3. {% comment -%} (c) {%- endcomment -%} Materials; Thickness; Specifications. All sidewalks, sidewalks
through driveways and driveway aprons shall be constructed of either Portland
Cement concrete or sandstone flagging in conformity with these specifications.
References to downtown areas shall include the following streets:
Washington Street - From Pleasant Drive to Walnut Street.
      Franklin Street - from the Main Street to Center Street.
N. Main Street - from May Court to Cottage Street.
Bell Street - from N. Main Street to the East Plaza Entrance.
      River Street.
      West Street.
      Orange Street - from Riverside Park to 500 feet west of West Street.
    1. {% comment -%} (1) {%- endcomment -%} Concrete for sidewalks shall be transit-mixed, State of Ohio,
Department of Transportation, Class “C” with a minimum cement content of 600
pounds per cubic yard and shall contain only non-silica bank run gravel and
sand as the aggregate.  Gray (non-white) colored Portland Cement shall be used.
    2. {% comment -%} (2) {%- endcomment -%} Stone flagging shall be of the best quality of Berea or Amherst
sandstone or a sandstone of a like type and quality.  The flagging shall be of
a uniform color and texture.  No flagging will be acceptable that is subject to
sealing or cupping.  The proportion of silica in the sandstone shall be at
least ninety percent (90%).
    3. {% comment -%} (3) {%- endcomment -%} Stone shall not be less than two and one-half inches in thickness
for walks and not less than four inches in thickness for driveways.  Each
flagstone shall not be less than three feet in length and not less in width
than the full width of the walk for walks up to and including eight feet in
width, and not less than four feet in width for walks more than eight feet in
width.
    4. {% comment -%} (4) {%- endcomment -%} The face of the flagging shall be smooth and in every direction
true to a straight edge. Sides shall be straight and dressed so that joints in
the walk will be closed for the upper one and one-half inches, and not more
than one inch open at the bottom.
4. {% comment -%} (d) {%- endcomment -%} Construction Methods (Portland Cement Concrete).
    1. {% comment -%} (1) {%- endcomment -%} Excavation.  The earth shall be excavated to a depth of four inches
(six inches at driveways) plus the thickness of the base course.  The entire
subgrade shall be shaped, tamped or rolled to secure a firm foundation.  The
contractor shall provide and use a template, riding on the forms, for testing
the top of the compacted base before the concrete is placed.  When sidewalk or
driveway apron is being replaced, the limits of the area to be removed shall be
defined by a straight full depth saw cut along an existing joint so as to
insure a vertical face for the new joint.
    2. {% comment -%} (2) {%- endcomment -%} Forms and contraction joints.  The sidewalk shall be constructed
between metal forms whose height is equal to the thickness of the walk, except
at driveways and curves where wooden forms may be used, providing they are full
depth.  
Unless otherwise ordered by the Chief Administrative Officer, forms shall be
set so that the back edge of the walk will be six inches on the street side of
the property line, at the designated grade.  The walk shall have a uniform
cross slope of one-quarter inch per foot of width toward the street center
line.  
All utility castings and other similar fixtures, shall be adjusted to the grade
of the completed walk prior to the pouring of the concrete.
Where the sidewalk concrete surrounds posts, poles, fire hydrants, gratings,
castings and the like, the concrete immediately adjacent to such objects shall
be separated from the remaining concrete by means of joints extending through
the full depth of the sidewalk concrete.  In general, these joints shall be
placed about six inches from poles, hydrants, etc. and arranged in the form of
squares or rectangles or as directed by the Chief Administrative Officer.
    3. {% comment -%} (3) {%- endcomment -%} Expansion joints.  An expansion joint one-half inch in width,
filled with a pre-molded bituminous strip of suitable dimensions, shall be
provided for the entire width and thickness of the concrete, every fifty feet
of length and at the junction of street intersections, adjoining walks, and
also along buildings and walls where the walks cover the entire space between
the curbing and other fixed objects.  Expansion joints shall also be provided
around fixed objects such as large gratings or castings, vault doors, utility
poles, foundations, area covers and the like.
    4. {% comment -%} (4) {%- endcomment -%} Placing and finishing concrete.  Concrete sidewalks, sidewalks
through driveways, and driveway aprons shall be constructed in one course, four
inches thick for sidewalks, five inches thick in downtown areas, and six inches
thick for sidewalks through residential driveways and driveway aprons, and
eight inches thick through commercial aprons by placing concrete between the
forms described above.  
The subgrade shall be adequately moistened just before the concrete is placed. 
The concrete shall be placed at a slump of two to three inches unless otherwise
ordered by the Chief Administrative Officer.  After placing, the concrete shall
be tamped, spaded and screeded.  Internal vibrators will not be required for
concrete sidewalks.  As soon as practical thereafter, the surface shall be
floated with a wooden float to a workmanlike finish, smooth and even but with a
slightly rough texture.  
Special care shall be exercised in finishing the surface on each side of the
expansion joints so as to avoid differences in elevation between adjacent
sections.  The top edges of sidewalk sections shall be rounded with a suitable
one-quarter inch radius edging tool.  The surface shall be divided into blocks
by forming joints with a grooving tool.  The joints shall be spaced equally at
intervals to form rectangular blocks.  The grooving tool shall leave a joint at
least one inch depth for the full width of the walk.
When the single sections of walk are constructed, they shall be separated from
the existing walk by means of at least one expansion joint, one-half inches in
thickness.  
Where drain pipes cross underneath sidewalks, the walk shall be marked near the
edge with a small triangle, not less than one inch on a side, impressed into
the concrete.  
Downtown areas shall be finished with an exposed aggregate (size 8 and smaller
bank run gravel) surface.  Walks wider than five feet shall have offset
longitudinal contraction joints to form a running bond pattern.  All offset “T”
joints shall receive a full depth sawcut to twelve inches, each side of the “T”
joint.
    5. {% comment -%} (5) {%- endcomment -%} Sidewalk through driveways and driveway aprons.  For sidewalk through
driveways and driveway aprons, the concrete shall be six inches in thickness
for residential drives and eight inches for commercial drives.  The spacing of
joints shall be regulated so that the driveway starts and ends at a joint with
as many joints in between as may be suitable.  In all other respects, driveways
shall be constructed as specified above for walks.  An expansion joint shall be
placed against the curb and where the apron butts up against the sidewalk for
the full width and depth of the driveway or driveway apron.
    6. {% comment -%} (6) {%- endcomment -%} Curing.  Immediately after the final finishing and after the free
water has disappeared, all exposed surfaces of the concrete shall be sealed by
spraying thereon, as a fine mist, a uniform application of clear membrane
curing material, meeting State of Ohio, Department of Transportation
Specifications.  The curing material shall be applied in a manner as to provide
a continuous uniform water-impermeable film without marring the surface of the
concrete.  The material shall be applied in one or more separate coats with an
approved mechanical spray at a minimum rate of one gallon of material for each
200 square feet of surface treated.  Delay in application of the curing
material will not be permitted.
    7. {% comment -%} (7) {%- endcomment -%} Protection.  The contractor shall be responsible for protecting the
walk against damage of all kinds until completed and accepted.  Foot traffic on
the walk shall not be permitted for forty-eight hours after placing the
concrete.  Auto traffic over the walk at driveways shall not be permitted for
forty-eight hours and then only on planks for seven days after placing
concrete.
All concrete placed when freezing temperatures are expected shall be insulated
to the satisfaction of the engineer for the duration of the curetime.
    8. {% comment -%} (8) {%- endcomment -%} Backfilling.  Forms shall be left in place for at least twenty-four
hours.  Any exposed “honey-combed” shall be patched before backfilling.  Edges
shall be carefully backfilled twenty-four hours after patching.
The contractor shall use every possible precaution to prevent injury to trees,
shrubbery and lawns which may be located on or near the site of the work, and
he shall not locate any equipment where the same would interfere with or injure
any trees, shrubbery or lawns.  All shrubbery and lawns, either within the
limits of the excavation or contiguous to the work, shall be replaced or
restored to a condition at least as good as at the time of the commencement of
the work.
5. {% comment -%} (e) {%- endcomment -%} Construction Methods (Sandstone Flagging).
    1. {% comment -%} (1) {%- endcomment -%} Excavation.  All the provisions of section 3.01 (Portland Cement
Concrete) of these specifications covering excavation for Portland Cement
concrete sidewalks and driveway aprons shall apply to grading for sandstone
sidewalks and driveways, except that the depth of excavation shall be modified
to accommodate the appropriate thickness of sandstone flagging.
    2. {% comment -%} (2) {%- endcomment -%} Old stone flagging taken up and relaid.  Flagging suitable for
relaying shall be taken up, rejointed and relaid in proper line and grade.  All
flagging not suitable for relaying shall be replaced with new flagging meeting
the requirements herein specified.
    3. {% comment -%} (3) {%- endcomment -%} Laying flagging.  The flagging for walks shall be laid with close
joints and brought to an even surface conforming to the proper alignment and
cross slope which is the same as that provided for Portland Cement concrete
sidewalks in section 3.02 (Portland Cement Concrete) of these specifications. 
The surface shall be free from depressions and inequalities.  Exposed sides
shall be pitched off to a continuous straight line conforming to the width of
the walk.  All utility castings and other similar fixtures, shall be adjusted
to grade by cutting neatly fitted openings in the flagging to accommodate the
casting.
    4. {% comment -%} (4) {%- endcomment -%} Backfilling and restoration.  Edges shall be carefully backfilled
upon completion of the laying of the sandstone flagging.  The contractor shall
use every possible precaution to prevent injury to trees, shrubbery and lawns
which may be located on or near the site of the work, and he shall not locate
any equipment where the same would interfere with or injure any trees,
shrubbery or lawns.  All shrubbery and lawns, either within the limits of the
excavation or contiguous to the work, shall be replaced or restored to a
condition at least as good as at the time of the commencement of the work.
