    3. {% comment -%} (3) {%- endcomment -%} Overlapping walls. A wall of one building shall be considered as
overlapping a wall of a second building when perpendicular lines extended from
that wall intersect the second wall.
    4. {% comment -%} (4) {%- endcomment -%} Length of overlap. The "length of overlap" shall be considered as
the length of the portion of one wall from which perpendicular lines will
intersect a second wall. In determining the length of overlap, the minimum
possible overlap shall be used for computation. 
    5. {% comment -%} (5) {%- endcomment -%} Facing walls. Although more than one set of walls may be
"overlapping" in the relationship between two buildings, only one set of two
walls shall be considered "facing". Facing walls shall be those two overlapping

regulations and standards.

<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. {% comment -%} (a) {%- endcomment -%} Building Design. In order to enhance privacy and to reduce the
apparent mass of the buildings, the alignment of attached single-family
dwellings should be varied and the facades of not more than every two dwelling
units shall be offset by at least sixteen inches. Variations in exterior
features such as facade, width, color, exterior materials and roof lines shall
be deemed desirable. Furthermore, parallel arrangements of buildings should be
avoided.
2. {% comment -%} (b) {%- endcomment -%} Site Design. Attached single-family developments shall be designed to
complement the topography of the land in order to utilize natural contours,
economize in the construction of utilities, reduce required grading, and
maximize the conservation of trees, watercourses and other natural features.
Natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be
integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the arrangements of
dwellings, open spaces and accessory uses.
3. {% comment -%} (c) {%- endcomment -%} Modifications to Area, Yard and Setback Requirements. With respect to
properties of irregular shape, or unusual topography, relative to other
properties in the same Zoning District, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
modify requirements regarding areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses
if compliance with these requirements is either clearly infeasible or contrary
to compliance with the design regulations and standards of this section.
However, the maximum permitted density shall not be increased by reason of this
provision. Applicants shall first seek modifications under this section prior
to filing an application as set forth in Section 1111.03 for a variance for areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses. 
4. {% comment -%} (d) {%- endcomment -%} Common Open Space. As required in Section 1127.03(i), at least 750 square feet of land per dwelling unit shall be
reserved as common open space in each ASF District.

under the provisions of this section shall conform to the characteristics
described below.

and water of such condition, size and shape as to be usable for passive
recreation and/or scenic enjoyment as appropriate to the site, the surrounding
area, and the expected resident population. Such area shall contain no
structures other than those related to recreational use and shall not include
roads, parking areas or private open space.
        2. {% comment -%} (B) {%- endcomment -%} Setback areas shall be excluded in the computation of common open
space.
        3. {% comment -%} (C) {%- endcomment -%} Consideration shall be given to the arrangement and location of
common open space to take advantage of physical characteristics of the site and
to place common open space within easy access and view of dwelling units.
Common open space shall not be separated from the development by existing
roads.
        4. {% comment -%} (D) {%- endcomment -%} Common open space shall not be depleted, reduced in size or
converted to any other use.
    2. {% comment -%} (2) {%- endcomment -%} Ownership and maintenance.
        1. {% comment -%} (A) {%- endcomment -%} The applicant shall submit copies of the proposed documents which

for development. No application shall be approved until such documents are
acceptable to the Municipality and the Law Director in form and content.
        2. {% comment -%} (B) {%- endcomment -%} Such common open space, including any recreational facilities
proposed to be constructed in such space, shall be clearly delineated on the
site plan together with descriptive data as to the methods to be employed to
preserve and maintain such open space.
        3. {% comment -%} (C) {%- endcomment -%} In the event the open space is owned in common by more than one
owner directly or indirectly, a non-profit association shall be incorporated
under the laws of the State of Ohio and shall own the open space in
unencumbered fee simple title.
        4. {% comment -%} (D) {%- endcomment -%} All common open space shown on the site plan must be owned by an
association or corporation solely owned and controlled by the dwelling unit
owners, and subject to legally enforceable declarations and restrictions. Such
declarations and restrictions shall grant enforcement rights to the
Municipality as a third-party beneficiary, and shall be reviewed by and must
obtain approval of the Law Director before final approval for development will
be granted. .
5. {% comment -%} (e) {%- endcomment -%} Pedestrian Circulation. Each attached single-family residential
development shall be served by a comprehensive walkway system adequately
separated from vehicular circulation, connecting residential buildings to
parking and recreation areas.
6. {% comment -%} (f) {%- endcomment -%} Utility Equipment. All utility lines serving an attached single-family
residential development shall be located underground.

to all dwelling units.
2. {% comment -%} (b) {%- endcomment -%} Garages.  Each garage shall be provided for the exclusive use of a
single dwelling unit and shall be attached to the residential structure which
contains that unit. Such garages may be attached to one another at side walls
in order to improve design.
3. {% comment -%} (c) {%- endcomment -%} Prohibited Activity.  The rebuilding, overhauling or dismantling of an
automotive vehicle or the storage of motor or body parts in an open yard is
