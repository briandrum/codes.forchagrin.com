## 731.03   Development standards

1. _(a)_ Minimum Tract. No permit shall be issued on a tract of less than
twenty acres. If a larger tract is required by the Rules and Regulations of the
Division of Oil and Gas, then such larger tract shall govern. A tract may be a
parcel in single ownership or a composite of land which is owned by several
persons or other separate entities. If the tract has more than one owner, then
a proper lease shall be executed between the applicant and all the owners of
the land. A copy of this unitized lease shall accompany the application for a
permit.
2. _(b)_ Well Location. Drilling sites, storage tanks and other equipment
shall be located to conform with the following:
    1. _(1)_ 200 feet from existing buildings on the tract, except as provided
in subsection (b)(2) hereof. For nonresidential buildings, except for schools
and other public places of assembly, this provision may be waived, in writing
by the owner and occupant of a building nearer than 200 feet from the proposed
well site or storage equipment provided that in no case shall such well or
equipment be nearer than 100 feet from such building. Such written
authorization shall be included with the application.
    2. _(2)_ 300 feet from schools or other public places of assembly as defined
in the Ohio Basic Building Code.
    3. _(3)_ 300 feet from adjacent properties.

and equipment may be within 100 feet of a public street right of way.
    5. _(5)_ Any greater distances which may be required pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 1509 shall govern.

These spacing requirements shall remain in effect until the well has been
plugged to the satisfaction of the Village and the Division of Oil and Gas.
3. _(c)_ Access Drives.
    1. _(1)_ Access drives from drilling sites or storage equipment to the
roadway shall be located to have the minimum impact on adjacent residential
properties.
    2. _(2)_ Access drives shall have a hard surface from the roadway to a point
forty feet along the access drive from the roadway. The hard surface shall be
eleven feet wide and constructed by placing three inches of asphalt on a six-
inch granular base; except that where the access drive enters a concrete
roadway, a concrete apron shall be placed from the roadway to the end of the
public right of way, whereupon the concrete apron shall meet the asphaltic hard
surface. The concrete apron shall be constructed of six-sack concrete and shall
be a thickness of six inches. From the end of the apron, access drives shall be
constructed of gravel, plank or appropriate material as determined by the
Village Engineer to assure that the surface is dust-free and adequate for the
vehicles intended.
    3. _(3)_ A gate shall be installed across the access drive at a point
adjacent to the roadway. Such gate shall be locked at all times when the
access road is not being used for well related purposes. Adjacent to the gate
shall be sufficient barriers by fencing, landscaping or mounding to reasonably
prevent unauthorized vehicle access to the well or storage sites. Sketch
drawings and/or written descriptions of the proposed gates and barriers,
adequate to indicate how the objective of preventing unauthorized access will
be achieved, shall be submitted with the permit application.
    4. _(4)_ Driveway culvert pipe shall be installed in accordance with Village
Codes.
    5. _(5)_ When a storage tank or well head is more than 300 feet from a
street right of way, the Fire Chief may require, in addition to the access
drive, an area developed and reserved for fire vehicles to turn around. When
required, such turnaround shall be a minimum of thirty feet long by twelve feet
wide provided further that the specific size, location and surface material
shall be determined and approved by the Fire Chief. The Fire Chief shall review
the application and report recommendations to the Planning Commission according
to the procedures of Section 731.02(c)(5).
4. _(d)_ General Requirements.
    1. _(1)_ No person engaged in drilling or operating any well shall permit

taken, is first submitted, in writing, to and approved in writing by the Fire
Chief.
    2. _(2)_ Within thirty days after any oil and/or gas well has been completed
for the production of oil and/or gas, or abandoned, the permittee shall remove
any drilling rig or derrick, remove the excess sludge or mud, fill all pits and
excavations, level off the surface of the working area, not allow any
accumulation of sludge or oil or other offensive or dangerous substances to
accumulate, keep his premises in a sanitary and sightly condition, and restore
any disturbed drainage facilities and leave the premises in such a condition
that no pooling of surface water will result.
    3. _(3)_ Wooden derricks or steam powered rigs shall not be permitted in
connection with drilling or any work over operations.
    4. _(4)_ Two dual-controlled, fluid operated blowout preventers with working
pressures equal to the maximum anticipated wellhead pressures shall be used for
all drilling or completion operations involving the use of drill pipe or tubing
after the surface casing has been set. The mechanical operation of the
preventers shall be checked every twenty-four hours and shall be tested with
pump pressure with enough frequency to insure good working order at all times.
    5. _(5)_ No oil, waste water, sludge water or salt water, produced or used
in connection with the drilling operation or production of oil or gas wells,
shall be disposed of within the Municipality and shall not be permitted to
empty into any sanitary sewer, storm sewer or surface drainage, unless, in an
emergency, such waste is to be used by the Village and authorized for such use
by the Chief Administrative Officer. However, temporary repositories for salt
water, waste or sludge water and basic sediment and water may be constructed of
concrete, steel or other material and in the latter case such pits for
temporary deposits shall be so constructed that no seepage shall result
therefrom and that surface water resulting from water drainage or rain, cannot
drain into such pit.
    6. _(6)_ Within six months of such completion or abandonment the area shall
be relandscaped to assure that all areas, other than access drives, are
restored with natural ground cover consistent with surrounding areas to avoid
any further erosion.
    7. _(7)_ All producing wells, wellheads, tank batteries, pumping units and
equipment appurtenant thereto shall be enclosed and protected by a six- foot
galvanized or aluminum chain link-type fence with matching-type gates and
effectively screened with evergreen plantings to the approval of the Chief
Administrative Officer.
    8. _(8)_ On residentially zoned land, each storage tank shall be a maximum
of 100 barrels (4,500 gallons) and a maximum of two storage tanks shall be
permitted for each well.
    9. _(9)_ The premises shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition free
from rubbish of every character, at all times, during the drilling operation
and as long thereafter as oil and/or gas is being produced therefrom. All
permittees’ premises shall be kept clear of high grass, weeds and combustible
trash or any other rubbish or debris that might constitute a fire hazard within
a radius of 100 feet around any oil tank or tanks, or producing wells.

(Ord. 2004-17. Passed 5-10-04.)

## 731.06   Administration

1. _(a)_ Permits for On-Site Connections. Any use or activity on the well
site of a gas or oil well which proposes to connect gas or oil lines directly
from the wellhead shall first obtain a plumbing and heating permit from the
Village. Applications shall be made to the Building Department.
2. _(b)_ Change of Ownership.  A permit issued pursuant to this chapter is not
transferable. A permit for a new owner of a proposed well, or well in
operation, shall only be issued when the new owner complies with all
application procedures of this chapter and the Village, according to the
procedures of this chapter, determines that such new owner complies with all
the regulations, standards, insurance and bonding requirements set forth
herein.
3. _(c)_ Inspections.
    1. _(1)_ Each well, related equipment, and well site shall be inspected by
the Village every six months to assure continued compliance with this chapter.
Any areas of noncompliance with this chapter which are identified during these
inspections shall be transmitted, in writing, to the owner of the well.
    2. _(2)_ After a reasonable period of time has elapsed, to enable the owner
to correct the identified deficiency, the Village shall make an additional
inspection (or inspections, as necessary) to assure that any areas of
noncompliance have been satisfactorily corrected and that the well, related
equipment, and the well site are in full compliance with this chapter. Fees for
all such additional inspections shall accrue at the rate of fifty dollars
($50.00) per hour with a minimum of fifty dollars ($50.00) per inspection and
the owner shall reimburse the Village for all accrued costs for such additional
inspections.
4. _(d)_ Insurance. An applicant, before being issued a permit hereunder shall
post and maintain with the Chief Administrative Officer satisfactory evidence
of liability insurance and yearly renewal coverage to compensate parties other
than the applicant for damages arising from the activities permitted hereunder
in an amount not less than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) coverage
for property loss for each occurrence and five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000) coverage for bodily injury for each occurrence. The applicant shall
establish such coverage to be for the benefit of the Village as well as
himself/itself, and does agree by application of the permit herein to indemnify
and save the Village harmless from any liability or loss arising from the
activities permitted hereunder. Such insurance policy shall remain in effect
one year after the Chief Administrative Officer has received written
confirmation from the State Division of Oil and Gas that the well has been
satisfactorily plugged in accordance with the regulations of the Division.
  
5. _(e)_ Bonding and Bond Forfeitures.
    1. _(1)_ An applicant, before being issued a permit hereunder, shall execute
and file with the Chief Administrative Officer a surety bond, conditional on
compliance with the foregoing regulations, in the amount of twenty thousand
dollars ($20,000) per well up to a maximum of one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000) per operator. The applicant may deposit with the Chief
Administrative Officer, in lieu of a surety bond, cash, or the equivalent of
cash, in the amount of the surety bond prescribed above. The surety bond
provided for in this section shall be executed by a surety company authorized
to do business in Ohio. The Chief Administrative Officer shall not approve any
bond until it is personally signed and acknowledged by both principal and
surety, or as to either by his attorney in fact, with a certified copy of the
power of attorney attached thereto. The Chief Administrative Officer shall not
approve such bond unless there is attached a certificate of the Superintendent
of Insurance that the company is authorized to transact a fidelity and surety
business in Ohio. All bonds shall be given in a form to be prescribed by the
Chief Administrative Officer and shall run to the Village as obligee.
    2. _(2)_ When the Chief Administrative Officer finds that an applicant has
failed to comply with regulations hereunder he shall make a finding of such
fact and declare any surety bond, or cash, filed to ensure compliance,
forfeited in an amount sufficient to correct any condition which adversely
affects the public health and safety, or is a condition prescribed in Section 731.04(b)(3); whereupon the Chief Administrative Officer shall certify the
forfeiture to the Director of Law who shall proceed to collect the amount
thereof. In lieu of forfeiture, the surety, at its option, may cause the
condition resulting in forfeiture to be corrected or pay to the Village Finance
Director the costs thereof. All funds collected under this section may be
expended by the Chief Administrative Officer to correct the condition
necessitating forfeiture. The owner may be released from the surety bond one
year after the Chief Administrative Officer has received written confirmation
from the State Division of Oil and Gas that the well has been satisfactorily
plugged in accordance with the regulations of the Division. Until the surety
bond is released by the Chief Administrative Officer in writing, such bond
shall remain in full force and effect for the benefit of the Village.
