effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving  waters.  
(Ord. 1968-738. Passed 9-17-68.)

## 911.07   Authority of superintendent

If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section 911.06, and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Superintendent may:

<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. _(a)_ Reject the wastes;
2. _(b)_ Require pretreatment to acceptable condition for discharge to public
sewers;
3. _(c)_ Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of
Section 911.09(d). If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent and to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.  
(Ord. 1968-738. Passed 9-17-68.)

## 911.08   Interceptors

the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other
harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.  
(Ord. 1968-738. Passed 9-17-68.)

## 911.09   Treatment; tests; special agreements

<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. _(a)_ Maintenance of Treatment Facilities. Where preliminary treatment or
flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
his expense.
2. _(b)_ Control Manholes. When required by the Superintendent, the owner of
any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and
other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling
and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly
and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved
by the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his
expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
3. _(c)_ Measurements, Tests, Analyses. All measurements, tests and analyses of
the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this
chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater" published by the American
Public Health Association and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. In the event
that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to determine the existence of hazards to life,
limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a
twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD
and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four hour composites of
all outfalls whereas pH is determined from periodic grab samples.
4. _(d)_ Special Agreements. No statement contained in Sections
911.04 to 911.08 and this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement
or arrangement between the Municipality and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the
Municipality for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial
concern.  
(Ord. 1968-738. Passed 9-17-68.)

1. _(a)_ The Superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the
Municipality bearing proper credentials and identifications shall be permitted
to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. The Superintendent or his representative shall have no authority to
inquire into any processes, including metallurgical, chemical, oil refining,
ceramic, paper or other industries beyond that point having a direct bearing on
the kind and source of discharge to the sewers or waterways or facilities for
waste treatment.
2. _(b)_ While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in subsection (a) hereof, the Superintendent or duly authorized employees of
the Municipality shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the company and the company shall be held harmless for injury or
death to the Municipal employees, and the Municipality shall indemnify the
company against loss or damage to its property by Municipal employees and
against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage
asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging and sampling
operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the company
to maintain safe conditions as required in Section 911.09(b).
3. _(c)_ The Superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the
Municipality bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted
to enter all private properties through which the Municipality holds a duly
