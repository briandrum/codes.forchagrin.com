## 733.01   Compliance required; definitions

No person shall conduct or operate any public dance or public dance hall
within the Municipality except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. As used in this chapter:

1. _(a)_ "Public dance" means any dance or entertainment at which dancing is
permitted which is open to the general public or at which a charge is made for
admission or  attendance.
2. _(b)_ "Public dance hall" means any room, place or space in which public
dances or public balls are held, for which dances or balls a charge or other
valuable consideration is made or demanded for admission thereto or
participation therein. The term shall also mean any hall or academy in which
classes in dancing are held and instruction in dancing is given for hire.

## 733.02   Public dances; permit required; fee

No public dance shall be held without first obtaining a permit therefor.
Such permit shall be issued by the Mayor upon application when he is satisfied
from information and investigation that such dance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare. The application shall state the time and place of holding
the dance, the closing hour, the fee or charge for admission or attendance, if
any, the person or persons who will be in charge or control thereof while the
same is being given and the person or persons promoting it. A fee of twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) shall be charged for the issuance of the permit for a
single dance or entertainment.

## 733.03   Public dance halls; license required; fee

No person shall conduct or operate any public dance hall without first
obtaining a license therefor. Such license shall be issued by the Mayor upon
application when he is satisfied from information and investigation that such
dance hall does not and will not constitute a threat to the public welfare. The
application shall contain such information as the Mayor shall deem necessary.
The fee for such license shall be six hundred dollars ($600.00) per year or any
fraction thereof. The license shall expire on December 31 and there shall be no
prorating of the fee.
