and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC’s are broken down into the
following categories:
      Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,

individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
24. {% comment -%} (x) {%- endcomment -%} "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" means a Federal program
enabling  property  owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.

construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any  work beyond the
stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
    2. {% comment -%} (2) {%- endcomment -%} Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing,  grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
    3. {% comment -%} (3) {%- endcomment -%} For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural

## 1353.07   Floodways

The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section 1353.03(b) identifies a segment within special flood hazard areas known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section 1353.04 (d)(3). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential.
The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:

<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. {% comment -%} (a) {%- endcomment -%} Prohibit encroachments, new construction, substantial improvements
and other development unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices demonstrates that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
2. {% comment -%} (b) {%- endcomment -%} If subsection (a) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section 1353.06 and this section.
3. {% comment -%} (c) {%- endcomment -%} Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase
in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by the
Chief Administrative Officer to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
must meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.  
(Ord. 2005-22.  Passed 4-11-05.)

## 1353.08   Establishment of buffer area

<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. {% comment -%} (a) {%- endcomment -%} Purpose. The buffer area is hereby established to limit impact of
land uses on rivers in order to preserve and conserve the quality, purity,
clarity and free-flowing condition of streams, maintain natural water
temperatures, preserve aquatic and terrestrial plant and animal habitat,
prevent erosion of stream banks, lessen the level of siltation of stream waters
and preserve valuable water resources in the interest of present and future
generations.
2. {% comment -%} (b) {%- endcomment -%} Boundary.  The buffer area shall be maintained along both sides of
stream channels which have a mean surface width at normal low water of at least
ten feet or greater and wet lands as defined by the Army Corps of Engineers and
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). The minimum
boundary of the buffer area shall be set at 120 feet in a horizontal plane
outward from the normal low water mark of the stream channel. It shall be
preserved in its natural state and shall be adjusted outward to include
sensitive areas such as steep slopes, wetlands and wooded areas adjacent to the
stream.
3. {% comment -%} (c) {%- endcomment -%} Permitted Uses. Use or activities shall not significantly affect the
natural quality of the area and are limited to the following:
    1. {% comment -%} (1) {%- endcomment -%} Passive recreational uses such as hiking, fishing, etc.
    2. {% comment -%} (2) {%- endcomment -%} Only damaged or diseased trees or those that the Administrator has
determined to be in imminent danger of being uprooted or falling in or along
the stream may be removed. The stump and root structure of trees on the stream
bank shall be left in place to retard bank erosion.
4. {% comment -%} (d) {%- endcomment -%} The buffer area described above shall be overlays to the existing
underlying districts as shown on the official Zoning Map of the Village, and as
such, the provisions for the flood plain buffer areas shall serve as a
supplement to the underlying district provisions. 
5. {% comment -%} (e) {%- endcomment -%} Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of any buffer area and those of any underlying district, the more
restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the flood plain buffer areas
shall apply.
6. {% comment -%} (f) {%- endcomment -%} In the event any provision concerning a flood plain buffer area is
declared inapplicable  as a result of any legislative or administrative
actions, or judicial discretion, the basic underlying district provision shall
remain applicable.

## 1353.09   FEMA letters for map revisions and amendments

Any individual, firm, or other non-community official, submitting a
revision  request to FEMA, should consult with the Chief Administrative
Officer. FEMA letters  of map revisions require submission of the Overview and
Concurrence form 3067-0148  which involves Village approval of the application
for both CLOMR and LOMR requests. According to CFR Title 44, Chapter 1, section
65.4, applications including the  submission of new technical data should come
from the CEO of the community. Otherwise, the application may be submitted by
the property owner with the required signatures of the requester, community
official, and engineer.
