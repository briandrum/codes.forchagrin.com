## 1503.01   Outdoor fires

1. _(a)_ No person shall knowingly, intentionally or negligently start, set,
kindle or maintain, or cause or order to start, set, kindle or maintain, or
assist in any way in the starting, setting, kindling or maintaining, or furnish
any material for, any fire in the open air upon any property within the
Municipality of such proportions as to create a hazard or endanger life or
property or which might be injurious to the health or comfort of any person, or
within 150 feet of any building, structure or article or thing of a combustible
nature, or being the owner, lessee, proprietor, occupant or person in control
of such property, permit any such fire to be started, set, kindled or
maintained thereon, without first making or causing to be made, application in
writing therefor to the Fire Chief and securing a permit in writing to do so.
2. _(b)_ No such permit, as referred to herein, shall be granted by the Chief
unless the fire or burning proposed to be permitted thereunder can be done
without danger of injury or damage to persons or property. The Chief is hereby
authorized to prescribe, as a condition of the issuance of such permit, such
regulations, conditions and safeguards as may in his judgment, be necessary to
provide adequately for the proper protection of persons and property. No such
permit shall be granted unless and until the applicant therefor has signed an
agreement to be responsible for and to reimburse the Municipality for any
expense by way of charges for services of fire equipment and otherwise may be
incurred by reason of such fire. A permit may be granted to the owner or
occupant of property for the burning thereon of the ordinary accumulation of
such personal rubbish or waste paper or other burnable material when the same
is proposed to be burned in a
proper and suitable incinerator provided for the purpose which incinerator has
first been approved by the Fire Chief.

property from the hazards of fire and explosions and for the use and occupancy
of buildings and structures and adjacent property.
    2. _(2)_ That the fire lane is incident to a retail, commercial or
manufacturing use or other use where it can be reasonably expected that the
public will assemble in sufficient number so that the presence of the public
and the motor vehicles, if not controlled, will interfere with the operation of
fire fighting equipment and personnel and the egress of occupants in the case
of fire.
2. _(b)_ Fire lanes shall be of such width as is reasonably determined by the
Chief to be necessary to permit access of occupants. Fire lanes shall be
suitably marked by appropriate markings on the ground or by displaying signs or
both. The markings shall be placed and maintained by the owner within ten days
of written notice or the Municipality shall place and install such sign and
charge the cost thereof to the owner.
3. _(c)_ No person shall obstruct a fire lane by parking or leaving standing a
motor vehicle, whether such a vehicle is attended or unattended; by
constructing a fence or barricade; or in any manner whatsoever. A barricade or
fence which is readily removable or through which access may be gained by fire
fighting equipment and personnel without delay shall not be prohibited by the
terms of this section. Any such permitted barricade or fence may not be locked
in any manner.
4. _(d)_ Attended motor vehicles found standing or parked in a fire lane shall
be immediately moved upon direction of any member of the Department of Public
Safety and Service. Any unattended motor vehicles found standing or parked in a
fire lane may be impounded in a manner and subject to the penalties and charges
set forth in Section 303.08 of the Traffic Code.
5. _(e)_ Obstructions, other than motor vehicles, found in fire lanes shall be
removed by the owner, occupant, or other person in charge of the premises
immediately after written notice of removal. Upon failure to comply with such
notice the Municipality may cause the obstruction to be removed and the owner,
occupant or other person in charge of the premises shall pay the cost of such
removal.
6. _(f)_ Whenever the Fire Chief designates a fire lane, written notice thereof
shall be given to the owner, occupant or person in charge of the premises. Such
designation may be appealed within ten days by filing a written objection to it
with the Fire Chief. The appeal shall be heard by Council, a majority of whom
may affirm, disaffirm or modify the designation. Their decision shall be final.

dangerous and in his opinion likely to cause a fire in any such buildings or
premises so inspected, he shall order the owner to correct such conditions
within a time stated in such order and such person shall comply with such order
without delay.
