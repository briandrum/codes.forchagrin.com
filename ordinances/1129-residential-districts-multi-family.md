(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1129.06   Distances between buildings and uses

In RMF-10 and RMF-15 Districts, land and structures shall be developed and
maintained in accordance with the following regulations regarding the required
distances between buildings and other uses.

1. _(a)_ Definitions and Measurement Standards. The following definitions and
measurement standards shall apply to terms used in this section.
    1. _(1)_ Main wall. Any exterior wall(s) of a residential building
containing the principal windows of a living, dining or sleeping room or rooms.
    2. _(2)_ Secondary wall. Any exterior wall(s) of a residential building,
other than a main wall, containing minor windows of a dining or sleeping room,
principal or minor windows of a kitchen or bathroom, or no windows.
    3. _(3)_ Overlapping walls. A wall of one building shall be considered as
overlapping a wall of a second building when perpendicular lines extended from
that wall intersect the second wall.
    4. _(4)_ Length of overlap. The "length of overlap" shall be considered as
the length of the portion of one wall from which perpendicular lines will
intersect a second wall. In determining the length of overlap, the minimum
possible overlap shall be used for computation.
    5. _(5)_ Facing walls. Although more than one set of walls may be
"overlapping" in the relationship between two buildings, only one set of two
walls shall be considered "facing". Facing walls shall be those two overlapping
walls for which the length of overlap is the greater.
2. _(b)_ Schedule of Distances. The minimum distance between walls of main
buildings and other walls or uses shall as set forth in the following schedule.
Building Wall               Other Wall or Use          Minimum Distance (feet)
Main wall, facing:          another main wall          40+x
                            secondary wall             30+x
                            accessory building         30
                            recreation facility        30
Secondary wall, facing:     another secondary wall     25+x
                            accessory building         20
                            recreation facility        20
Accessory building, facing: another accessory building 15
                            private road               10
x = length of overlap divided by 5     
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1129.07   Design regulations and standards

     In RMF-10 and RMF-15 Districts, land and structures shall be developed and
maintained in accordance with the following design regulations and standards.

1. _(a)_ Building Design. The maximum length of any multi-family residential
building shall be 100 feet. Buildings may be attached if it is determined by
the Planning and Zoning Commission that site design will be improved as a
result. However, attached buildings shall be designed with visible offsets or
setbacks not less than six feet in depth or with substantial variations in
alignment. To reduce the apparent mass of buildings, variations in facade,
width, color, exterior materials and roof lines shall be deemed desirable;
furthermore, parallel arrangements of buildings should be avoided.
2. _(b)_ Site Design. Multi-family residential developments shall be designed
to complement the topography of the land in order to utilize natural contours,
economize in the construction of utilities, reduce required grading and
maximize the conservation of trees, watercourses and other natural features.
Natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be
integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the arrangements of
dwellings, open spaces and accessory uses.
3. _(c)_ Modifications to Area, Yard and Setback Requirements. With respect to
properties of irregular shape, or unusual topography, relative to other
properties in the same Zoning District, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
modify requirements regarding areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses
if compliance with these requirements is either clearly infeasible or contrary
to compliance with the design regulations and standards of this section.
However, the maximum permitted density shall not be increased by reason of this
provision. Applicants shall first seek modifications under this section prior
to filing an application as set forth in Section 1111.03 for a variance for areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses. 
4. _(d)_ Common Open Space. As required in Section 1129.03(f), at least 750 square feet of land per dwelling unit shall be
reserved as common open space in RMF-10 and RMF-15 Districts.
    1. _(1)_ Required characteristics. Land designated as common open space
under the provisions of this section shall conform with the characteristics
described below.
        1. _(A)_ Common open space shall consist of land or a combination of land
and water of such condition, size and shape as to be usable for active
recreation and/or scenic enjoyment as appropriate to the site, the surrounding
area, and the expected resident population. Such area shall contain no
structures other than those related to recreational use and shall not include
roads or parking areas.
        2. _(B)_ Setback areas shall be excluded in the computation of common open
space.
        3. _(C)_ Consideration shall be given to the arrangement and location of
common open space to take advantage of physical characteristics of the site and
to place common open space within easy access and view of dwelling units. 
Common open space shall not be separated from the development by existing
roads.
        4. _(D)_ Common open space shall not be depleted, reduced in size or
converted to any other use.
    2. _(2)_ Ownership and maintenance.
        1. _(A)_ The applicant shall submit copies of the proposed documents which
provide for the permanent preservation of open space at the time of application
for development. No application shall be approved until such documents are
acceptable to the Municipality and the Law Director in form and content.
        2. _(B)_ Such common open space, including any recreational facilities
proposed to be constructed in such space shall be clearly delineated on the
site plan together with descriptive data as to the methods to be employed to
preserve and maintain such open space.
        3. _(C)_ In the event the open space is owned in common by more than one
owner directly or indirectly, a non-profit association shall be incorporated
under the laws of the State of Ohio and shall own such open space in
unencumbered fee simple title.
        4. _(D)_ All common open space shown on the site plan must be owned in
unencumbered fee simple title by an association or corporation solely owned and
controlled by the dwelling unit owners, and subject to legally enforceable
declarations and restrictions. Such declarations and restrictions shall grant
enforcement rights to the Municipality as a third-party beneficiary and shall
be reviewed by and must obtain approval of the Law Director before final
approval for development will be granted.
5. _(e)_ Pedestrian Circulation. Each multi-family residential development
shall be served by a comprehensive walkway system, adequately separated from
vehicular circulation, connecting residential buildings to parking and
recreation areas.
6. _(f)_ Utility Equipment. All utility lines serving a multi-family
residential development shall be located underground. All rooftop mechanical
equipment shall be enclosed in a manner which complements the architectural
style of the building on which it is located.
7. _(g)_ Off-Street Parking. In addition to the applicable regulations of
Chapter 1141, in multifamily developments, a minimum of one-half (0.5) off-street
parking space per dwelling unit shall be provided in unenclosed common parking
areas distributed throughout the development in a manner providing convenient
access to all dwelling units.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1129.08   Supplemental regulations

1. _(a)_ Prohibited Activity.  The rebuilding, overhauling or dismantling of an
automotive vehicle or the storage of motor or body parts in an open yard is
prohibited. The outside parking and storage of recreational vehicles is
prohibited.
2. _(b)_ Supplemental Regulations. For regulations regarding off-street
parking and loading, landscaping, lighting, signs and environmental
performance, refer to Chapters
1141 -
1150 of the Planning and Zoning Code.
