## 1323.01   Application of state standards; conflict

In addition to all the conditions and requirements of this Building Code,
the requirements of the Ohio State Building Code for all occupancies named in
such Code, and all Building Code Rules and Regulations of the Ohio Board of
Building Standards and all published building code requirements of the Division
of Factory and Building Inspection of the Ohio Department of  Industrial
Relations shall represent the minimum requirements for all buildings proposed
to be constructed and erected in the Municipality. Such requirements are hereby
incorporated and made a part of this Building Code as if the same were written
into such Building Code in their entirety. In case of conflict between them,
the stricter provisions shall prevail.
