manner approved by the property owner and the franchising authority, restore
any property to as good condition as before the work causing such disturbance

delivered or provided at least 24 hours prior to entry. Nothing herein shall be
construed as authorizing access or entry to private property, or any other
property, where such right to access or entry is not otherwise provided by law.

reimburse the property owner 100% of the cost of the damage or replace the

activity related to a cable service or other service provided by the cable
operator to its customers.
6. _(f)_ Billing.
    1. _(1)_ Bills will be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be
fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and
premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills will also clearly

    2. _(2)_ In case of a billing dispute, the cable operator must respond to a
written complaint from a subscriber within 30 days.
    3. _(3)_ Refunds. Refund checks will be issued promptly, but no later than
either:

    4. _(4)_ Credits. Credits for service will be issued no later than the
customer’s next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is

7. _(g)_ Complaint Procedures.
    1. _(1)_ Any verbal, telephonic or written complaint relating to the
quality or continuity of service shall be attended to within a normal service
interval. In the event that such complaints are not responded to or service is
not restored to the levels required by the FCC or by the terms of this chapter
during said normal service interval, the subscriber shall be entitled to a
rebate of his or her monthly service charge or an item of comparable value,
whichever is greater, for the missed appointment. This provision shall not
apply if such delay is occasioned because of an Act of God, strike, national
emergency or any other circumstance beyond the control of the cable operator.
Similarly, this provision shall not apply to service requests or complaints
pertaining to television set malfunction or other breakdown not related to the
operation of the cable television system. The Village Complaint Officer,
provided for in subsection (g)(3) hereof, shall be responsible for invoking
said penalty upon receiving written subscriber complaint. The Complaint Officer
shall hold a hearing on such complaint to be conducted in the manner prescribed
in and otherwise governed by subsection (g)(3) hereof.
    2. _(2)_ The cable operator shall establish procedures for receiving,
acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints. The cable operator shall
furnish a notice of such procedures to each subscriber at the time of initial
subscription to the system. In addition, the cable operator shall maintain a
written record, printout, or "log", listing date and time of customer
complaints, identifying the subscriber, and describing the nature of the
complaints and when and what action was taken by the cable operator in response
thereto. Such records shall be kept for a period of three years at cable
operator’s local office, reflecting the operations to date subject to
applicable laws regarding subscriber privacy and shall be made available for
inspection during regular business hours.
    3. _(3)_ The Mayor or a designee shall serve as the Village Complaint
Officer with primary responsibility for the continuing administration of
complaint procedures hereunder. Any subscriber, user, programmer, or other
interested person who has a complaint regarding the quality of cable television
service, equipment malfunctions, billings or any other matter, which remains
unsolved for 30 days after it has been brought to the cable operator’s
attention, may file a complaint, in writing, with the Complaint Officer. Upon
the filing of such a complaint, said Complaint Offficer shall notify the cable
operator and make an investigation to determine whether or not there is a
probable cause to credit the allegations. If the Complaint Officer determines
after such investigation that there is probable cause to credit the allegations
of the complaint, the Complaint Officer shall notify the cable operator and
complainant and promptly endeavor to resolve the matter by conciliation and
persuasion.  
In the event that the Complaint Officer is unable to obtain
conciliation within a reasonable time, the matter shall be promptly set for a
hearing where all parties may give evidence and the merits of the dispute will
be decided. The Complaint Officer shall make the decision public, along with a
statement reciting the basis therefor. Within 30 days thereafter, either the
cable operator or the complainant may appeal to the Council, in writing, the
decision rendered by the Complaint Officer. At the appeal hearing, the
aggrieved party may contest the findings of fact or interpretation of
controlling law, at which time the Council may afffirm, reject or modify the
decision of the Complaint Offficer. The affirmance, rejection or modification
of said decision by the Council shall be final unless appealed by the grantee
to a court of competent jurisdiction.
    4. _(4)_ Where there have been similar complaints made, or when there
exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the Complaint Officer, casts
doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the Complaint Offficer
shall have the right and authority to compel the cable operator to test,
analyze and report on the performance of the system. Such report shall be
delivered to the Complaint Officer no later than 14 days after said Officer
formally notifies the cable operator and shall include the following
information: the nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests;
what system component(s) was tested, the equipment used, and procedures
employed in resolving said complaints, if applicable; and any and all
additional information deemed relevant by the Complaint Officer.
    5. _(5)_ Said tests and analysis shall be supervised by a qualified
engineer not on the permanent staff of the cable operator and selected by the
Village. The aforesaid engineer shall sign all records of special tests and
forward to the Complaint Officer such records with a report interpreting the
results of the test and recommending action to be taken by the Village.
    6. _(6)_ The cable operator shall notify each subscriber at the time of
initial installation of the name and address of the Village Complaint Officer
and of the procedures contained in this section.  
(Ord. 2001-18. Passed 3-12-01.)
  

## 763.04   Customer dissatisfaction with any service

Any customer who requests disconnection of cable service or any particular
programming service previously ordered shall have disconnection effective on
the day such request is made. The customer will not be charged thereafter for
any service disconnected and, in the case of a service for which the customer

refund of the unused portion of the prepaid amount.

## 763.05   Safety

investigate such condition immediately and shall take such measures as are
necessary to remove or eliminate any unsafe condition.  
(Ord. 2001-18. Passed 3-12-01.)

## 763.99   Penalty

Should it be found that after conducting the hearing and appeal procedure
provided in this chapter, that the cable operator is in violation of the terms
of the service standards, the penalties chargeable shall be as outlined and
limited in Section 19 of the Franchise Agreement.  
(Ord. 2001-18. Passed 3-12-01.)
