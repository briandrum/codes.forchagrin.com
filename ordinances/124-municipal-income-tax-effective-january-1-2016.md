Municipality for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred

tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average
original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
                 (b)     Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during

services performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the

excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Section 124.04 (C);
                 (c)       Total gross receipts of the business or profession

alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
                     (i)       Separate accounting;
                     (ii)       The exclusion of one or more of the factors;

factors that would provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the
taxpayer to the municipal corporation;
                     (iv)       A modification of one or more of the factors.
                 (b)     A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed
appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may
use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section 124.12 (A).
                 (c)       The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use
an alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section 124.12 (A).
                 (d)       Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies
or otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the

investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
                 (c)     Any other location, if the Tax Administrator
determines that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at
the other location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or
(b) of this section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal
income tax liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the
employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the Tax Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.

sitused to the Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in

Withholding provisions.
   (A)   Effective January 1, 2017, each employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located or doing business in the Municipality shall withhold an
income tax from the qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in
the Municipality. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not
required under Section 124.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section 124.01 of this chapter, of one and eighty-five hundredths percent (1.85%). An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)       Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or
if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200. 
      Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the
Tax Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days after the last day of each
month for which the tax was withheld.
                 (b)       Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
not required to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following
the last day of each calendar quarter.
         (c)       Intentionally left blank.
    2. _(2)_ If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer’s, agent’s, or other payer’s obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
    3. _(3)_ An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Municipality as the
return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax
under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
            (4)       An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold Municipal Income Tax with respect to an individual’s
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation’s successor entity.
          (5)     (a)       An employee is not relieved from liability for a
tax by the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
withhold the tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s,
or other payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
                 (b)     The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
            (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject
to a Municipal income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
            (7)       Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
required to withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to
be withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount
shall be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
            (8)       On or before the last day of February of each year, an
employer shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax
Administrator listing:
                 (a)       The names, addresses, and social security numbers of
all employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Municipality during the preceding calendar year;
                 (b)       The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such
employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
                 (c)       The name of every other municipal corporation for
which tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during
the preceding calendar year;
                 (d)       Any other information required for federal income
tax reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent
form with respect to such employee;
                 (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax
Administrator.
            (9)     The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
            (10)     An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipal
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer’s control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
            (11)     The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by
an employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise
required to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section.

                 (b)       "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing
business in this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar
location owned or controlled by an employer.
                 (c)     "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to
which an employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and
ordinary basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties
on a regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work"
means the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to
report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee
is not required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis
to a fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee’s
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

                 (g)     "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than twenty (20) days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does
not include the home of an employee.
    2. _(2)_ (a)     Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), and (6) of this section,
an employer is not required to withhold Municipal income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the
Municipality if the employee performed such services in the Municipality on
twenty (20) or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following
conditions applies:
            (i)     The employee’s principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
                     (ii)       The employee performed services at one or more
presumed worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this
division, "presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in the Municipality at which the employer provides or
provided services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the
employer to last more than twenty (20) days in a calendar year. Services can
"reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty (20) days" if
either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
                          (a)     The nature of the services is such that it
will require more than twenty (20) days of the services to complete the
services;
                          (b)       The agreement between the employer and its
customer to perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the
services at the location for more than twenty (20) days.
            (iii)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages
as provided in Section 124.04.
                     (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid
for the performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional
athlete, professional entertainer, or public figure.
                 (b)     For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this
section, an employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing
services in the Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing
services for or on behalf of the employer in the Municipality than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee’s principal place of work:
                     (i)     Traveling to the location at which the employee
will first perform services for the employer for the day;
                     (ii)     Traveling from a location at which the employee

refurbished, processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee’s employer;
                     (iv)     Transporting or delivering property described in
division (C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the
property, the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property
to real estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s
employer;
                     (v)       Traveling from the location at which the
employee makes the employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either
the employee’s principal place of work or a location at which the employee will
not perform services for the employer.
            (3)     If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
    4. _(4)_ (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Municipality exceeds the twenty (20) day threshold,
the employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Municipality for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Municipality.
                 (b)       An employer required to begin withholding tax for
the Municipality under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold
tax for the Municipality for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer
paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Municipality.
            (5)       If an employer’s fixed location is the Municipality and
the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section 124.02, the employer shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the
employee’s qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Municipality, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the Municipality.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer’s federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
            (6)       Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not
apply to the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an
agreement regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the
requirements of Section 124.04.

            (1)     The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all
nonresident individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer under Section 124.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer’s sole income

income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.

             (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer’s federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or in
the case of a return or a request required by a qualified municipal
corporation, Ohio Form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any
other documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended
return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this
section electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the
foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such
copies after the return has been filed.
              (3)       The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is
not an individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net
profit return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of
only the following documents: the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form

A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
              (4)       After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax
Administrator may request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information,
statements, or documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify
the taxpayer’s municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under

a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
 
   (G)     (1)     (a)       Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be

            (2)     Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Municipality’s income
tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality’s income tax return shall
be the fifteenth (15th) day of the tenth (10th) month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under
this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Administrator grants an extension of that date.
                 (a)       A copy of the federal extension request shall be
included with the filing of the Municipality’s income tax return.
                 (b)     A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may submit
a written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer’s Municipal income tax return. 
If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Municipal income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer’s requested extension.
            (3)     If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of
the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of
the Municipality’s income tax return. The extended due date of the
Municipality’s income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of
the state income tax return.
            (4)       If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order
to ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required
to file annual returns.
            (5)       To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of

Municipality for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section
shall file with the Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)
(3) of this section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) of this section
apply.
    3. _(3)_ (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Municipality income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
              (i)     The person was required to file a tax return with
Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 124.04(C)(1)(g)) within Municipality.
              (ii)     The person no longer provides services in Municipality
and does not expect to be subject to Municipality income tax for the taxable
year.
         (b)     The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Municipality. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within Municipality, make any sales in Municipality, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by Municipality during the taxable year. If
the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by Municipality for the
taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
comply as a taxpayer with Municipality income tax ordinance and rules and
regulations."  The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)     If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) of this section the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file
and tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change.
         (d)     Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
 
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered made on the date of the timestamp assigned by
the first electronic system receiving that payment; for purposes of this
section, "receiving that payment" refers to the transfer of funds from the
account of the taxpayer since such funds are no longer under the control of the
taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section 124.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Municipality , unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Chapter and any of the  Municipality’s ordinances,
resolutions, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.

An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)     (1)     If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first (181st) day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. 
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
            (2)     If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred
eighty-first (181st) day after the applicant’s active duty or service
terminates.
            (3)       Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)

time in which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation
in accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the

(P)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)       For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this

Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
            (2)       An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five (5) year consolidated municipal income tax return

intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year shall file a

            (2)       No corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section 124.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
            (3)       If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having
at least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
                (a)     Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss
from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for
the purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section 124.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
                 (b)       Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss
in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section 124.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
            (4)       If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having
less than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
                 (a)       The corporation filing the consolidated municipal
income tax return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss
from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for
the purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y)
of Section 124.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to the
Municipality;
                 (b)       The pass-through entity shall be subject to
Municipal income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this
Chapter on the basis of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
 
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section 124.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
 
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter on
the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for
any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Municipality who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter, may
claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter upon
satisfactory evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject
to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed seventy-five
percent (75%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the

grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
 
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)   Intentionally left blank.

"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
            (2)       Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint
declarations of estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules

declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.
            (5)       The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may
be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
 
   (C)   (1)     The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
                 (a)     On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth

year.
            (2)     When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
            (3)       On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th)
month of the year following that for which the declaration or amended
declaration was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which
may be due shall be paid with the return in accordance with Section 124.05.
 
   (D)   (1)       In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section 124.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
                 (a)     For the first payment of estimated taxes each year,
twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount
of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

date prescribed for that payment.
            (2)     The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
 
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
            (1)     The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
            (2)       The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least one hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the
taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately
preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer
filed a return with the Municipality under Section 124.05 for that year.
            (3)       The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality but was not domiciled there on the first (1st) day of January of

under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.09   Requests for refunds

     (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as
in Section 124.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:

    2. _(2)_ Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars

   (C)   (1)     Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was due or paid,
whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor’s claim for
a refund.
            (2)       On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator
shall determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the
appropriate municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in
division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an
assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially
denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was denied,

instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section 124.21.
 
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

            (2)       The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such
last day.
            (3)       The request is delivered by the postal service, no
postmark date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the
date of the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received

   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section 124.18 (A)(4).

## 124.10   Second municipality imposing tax after time period allowed for refund

   (A)       Income tax that has been deposited with the Municipality, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Municipality as a refund but is subject to the three (3) year limitation on
refunds.
 
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Municipality is subject to recovery by
Municipality. If the Municipality’s tax on that income is imposed after the
time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, the Municipality shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding the Municipality claims is due with respect to such income
or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages.
   
   (C)   If the Municipality’s tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Municipality’s tax rate. However, if the Municipality’s tax rate is greater
than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.11   Amended returns

   (A)     (1)       If a taxpayer’s tax liability shown on the annual tax
return for the Municipality changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Municipality. The amended return shall be filed on a
form required by the Tax Administrator.
            (2)     If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated
municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate
return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal
income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before
filing the amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return only:
                 (i)     To determine the amount of tax that would be due if
all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
                 (ii)       If the applicable statute of limitations for civil
actions or prosecutions under Section 124.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
            (2)       The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount
of tax that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments
were reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
 
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section 124.09.
            (2)       The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of
refund that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments

reopened to determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.

dollars.

## 124.12   Limitations

   (A)   (1)   (a)     Civil actions to recover Municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on Municipal income taxes shall be brought within the

                   (i)       Three (3) years after the tax was due or the
return was filed, whichever is later; or
                     (ii)       One (1) year after the conclusion of the
qualifying deferral period, if any.
                 (b)       The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of
this section may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the
employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to
the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (C) of this section.
            (2)       As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period"
means a period of time beginning and ending as follows:
                 (a)       Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by
an assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section 124.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
                 (b)       Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes
final or, if any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax
Review, the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on which the final determination
of the Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole
or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
 
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,
failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more
of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six (6)
years after the commission of the offense.
 
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section 124.09.
 
   (D)   (1)       Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
    2. _(2)_ If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, or the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section 124.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section 124.09. 
   (E)   No civil action to recover Municipal income tax or related penalties

            (1)       The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal
the imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
            (2)       The period during which an appeal related to the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.13   Audits

   (A)       At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer’s rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
 
   (B)       Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)       At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
     A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer’s attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
     This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is
not an attorney.
 
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer’s case.
   
   (F)       If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.14   Service of assessment

     (A)       As used in this section:
            (1)       "Last known address" means the address the Tax
Administrator has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail,
or any address the Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such
as the use of a change of address service offered by the postal service or an
authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
            (2)       "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the
postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the
ORC is not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when
the reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or
accept the assessment.
 
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)       If certified mail is returned because of an
undeliverable address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to
ascertain a new last known address, including the use of a change of address
service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under
Section 5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a
new last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and
considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days
after the assessment’s postmark.
                 (b)     Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipal
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Board of Tax Review within sixty (60)
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
            (2)     If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten (10) days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by
ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
 
   (D)     (1)       A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty (20%) percent, as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee’s business.
            (2)       If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within
sixty (60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other
Municipal official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Review.
 
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator’s designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
 
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.15   Administration of claims

     (A)       As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount
payable to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the Municipality’s income
tax imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
 
   (B)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
Municipality:
            (1)       Compromise a claim;
            (2)       Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a
claim by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)       A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to
the compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
 
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.16   Tax information confidential

   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person’s official duties or the official business of the Municipality
as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
 
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.17   Fraud

     No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Municipal ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

     (B)     (1)       This section applies to the following:
                 (a)     Any return required to be filed under applicable law
for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
                 (b)       Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding
tax required to be paid or remitted to the Municipality on or after January 1,
2016.
            (2)     This section does not apply to returns required to be filed
or payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the
filing or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be
made before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date, shall be
subject to the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January
1, 2016, of the Municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment

   (C)     Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

## 124.19   Authority of tax administrator; verification of information

Authority.
   (A)     Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
    1. _(1)_ (a)       Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as

papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the

re-determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;

may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal

employer, or other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator
believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator’s inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six (6) years following the end of the taxable year to which the

longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such
tax.
            (3)     The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person
that the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any
income that was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction
tending to affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose,
compel any such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such
person’s possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
            (4)     No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)     Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person’s social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
            (2)     (a)       If the Tax Administrator makes a request for
identifying information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid
identifying information within thirty (30) days of making the request, nothing

the person to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section 124.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section 124.99.
                 (b)       If a person required by the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a
change with respect to that information as required under division (C) of
Section 124.19 within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring
such identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section 124.18.
                 (c)     The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a)
and (b) of this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax
or fee with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in
addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section 124.99 for a violation of Section 124.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

subject to appeal.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

members. Two (2) members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or
contractors with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five
(5) years immediately preceding the date of appointment. One (1) member shall
be appointed by the Mayor, or his/her administrative official designee, of the
Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but may not
be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or
other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
            (2)     The term for members of the Board of Tax Review appointed
by the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two (2) years. There

            (3)       Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority
vote for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a
member, the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges
against the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in
person or by counsel in the member’s own defense upon not less than ten (10)
days’ notice. The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final
and not appealable.

ceases to meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section
shall resign immediately by operation of law.
            (5)       A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the
same manner as the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the
vacancy was created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to
the expiration of the term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed
shall hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of
Tax Review shall impair the power and authority of the remaining members to
exercise all the powers of the Board of Tax Review.
            (6)       If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board
of Tax Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar
reason, the legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed
the member shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board
of Tax Review in the member’s place. The appointment of such an individual
shall be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to
the appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
 
   (B)       Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax Review.

assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within
sixty (60) days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty (60) days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at
law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax
Review may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.
In such a case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the first (1st) day of the hearing unless the parties agree
otherwise.
 
   (E)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator’s assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days
after the Board of Tax Review’s final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of
its final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal
within fifteen (15) days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or
the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review’s final determination
as provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
 
   (F)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section 149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

## 124.28   Definitions

If a term used in sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances.

As used in sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances only:
     (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to
the municipal corporation under section
124.29 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
     (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as
a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised
Code and section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation’s federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
            (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
            (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income
deducted under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
            (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
            (4)     (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this
section, deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the
extent the income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
                  (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to
the extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or
1250 of the Internal Revenue Code.
            (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a
deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
            (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
            (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
            (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
            (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned
directly or indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal
taxable income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net
profit in the group’s federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)
(b)  of section
124.33 of the Codified Ordinances.
            (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned
directly or indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal
taxable income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in
the group’s federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
124.33 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (48)(b) of section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (48)(b)of section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
     (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
     (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports
required to be filed pursuant to sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
     (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer’s fiscal
year ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which
the calculation of the taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income is based
pursuant to this chapter. If a taxpayer’s taxable year is changed for federal
income tax purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections 124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
Tax Commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
     (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.29   Applicability; taxable situs; apportionment

This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality and that has made the election under section
 124.27 of the Codified Ordinances.
     (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
              (1)    The average original cost of the real property and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average
original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used
by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
              (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual’s services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
section
124.04(C) of the Codified Ordinances;
            (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from
sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
     (B)    (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner
may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
                 (a)    Separate accounting;
                 (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
                 (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that
would provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to
the municipal corporation;
                 (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
            (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed
appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may
use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of
section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances.
            (3)    The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this
section only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by division (A) of section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances.
     (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
            (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to,
or under the possession of one of the following:
                  (a)    The employer;
                  (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the
employer, or a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
                (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
            (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
            (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Commissioner’s determination was unreasonable.
     (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the
Municipality as follows:
            (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the Municipality only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
                 (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the
Municipality from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
                 (b)    The property is delivered within the Municipality from
a location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
          (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the
Municipality.
            (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents
and royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused
to the Municipality.
            (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible
personal property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
       (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to
the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
Municipality in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality based upon
the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the Municipality to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
     (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section
 124.02 of the Codified Ordinances by the Municipality or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s
net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality. In no case shall a
taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the
Municipality any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality
under this section.
     (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the
owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the property,
payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

     (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by sections

such information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a proper
judicial order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised
Code. The Tax Commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service with copies

identification number of every taxpayer that made estimated payments that are
attributable to the Municipality and the amount of each such taxpayer’s
estimated payment.

shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the
Municipality Tax Administrator under section 718.83(D) of the Revised Code.

pursuant to section 718.84(E) of the Revised Code, provide tax returns and
other information it receives in the performance of its administration of the
municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in section
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances. The Tax Administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer
for audit by the Tax Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner and shall include any information that forms
the basis for the referral.
            (2)    If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer
referred by the Tax Administrator under this section, the Municipality reserves
its right to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to
ensure that the correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the
taxpayer.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.31   Filing of annual return; remittance; disposition of  funds

     (A)     (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under section
124.35 of the Codified Ordinances, shall be submitted to the Tax Commissioner,
on a form and in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, on or before
the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer’s
taxable year.
            (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with sections
124.28,
124.29, and, if applicable,
124.33 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
            (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of
state and in the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. If the amount payable
with the tax return is ten dollars or less, no remittance is required.
 
   (B)    (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer’s identification number. Each return shall be verified by a
declaration under penalty of perjury.
            (2)    (a)    The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to
include, with each annual tax return, amended return, or request for refund
filed with the commissioner under sections 124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, copies of any relevant documents or other
information.
                 (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return
electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner shall either submit the documents required
under this division electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if
electronic submission is not available, mail the documents to the Tax
Commissioner. The department of taxation shall publish a method of
electronically submitting the documents required under this division on or
before January 1, 2019.
            (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Commissioner
may request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer’s municipal income tax.
 
   (D)    (1)    (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the Tax
Commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
                 (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request
that the Tax Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date
for filing the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the Tax Commissioner
receives the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is
due, the Tax Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer’s extension request.
                 (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of
this section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.
            (2)    If the Tax Commissioner considers it necessary in order to
ensure payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
124.01 and
124.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the Tax Commissioner may require taxpayers
to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
 
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning
questions that arise during the examination or other review of the return and
authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the Tax Commissioner
with information that is missing from the return, to contact the Tax
Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Tax Commissioner and has shown to the preparer
or other person.
 
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

manner as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the Tax Commissioner, on a form prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and
make payments electronically. For good cause shown, the Tax Commissioner may
excuse the applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the
returns or make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (C)    The Tax Commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
    1. _(1)_ The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns

electronic means.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.33   Consolidated returns

     (A)    As used in this section:
            (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group
as defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
            (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a
consolidated return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section
1501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    3. _(3)_ "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
              (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as
in section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
            (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as
in section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
 
   (B)    (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
            (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns
under this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month of the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax
return election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The
election to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-
year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
            (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this
section is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations
subject to a municipal income tax.
            (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of section
124.05(R) of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for
the remainder of the five-year period.
            (5)    When an election made under section
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
 
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm’s length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.
 
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
     (E)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and
(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
124.28 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation’s" for "a C corporation’s" wherever "a C corporation’s" appears in
that division.
            (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make
any adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
124.28 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
            (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
                (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss
from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for
the purpose of making the computations required in section
124.29 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group’s net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
                (b)    Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
 124.29 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group’s net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity’s net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having
less than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
 124.29 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group’s net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
                (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity’s net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
 
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
124.29 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
 
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.34   Failure to pay tax

If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.35   Declaration of estimated taxes

     (A)    As used in this section:
            (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a
taxpayer’s income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state
for a taxable year.
            (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer
reasonably estimates to be the taxpayer’s combined tax liability for the
current taxable year.
 
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
            (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a
taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a
declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
            (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or
before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable
year or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.
            (4)    The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
              (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
                   (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of
the combined tax liability for the taxable year;
                   (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
                   (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of
the combined tax liability for the taxable year;
                   (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month
of the taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year.
            (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated
taxes will not accurately reflect the taxpayer’s tax liability for the taxable
year, the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
            (3)    (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of
estimated taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that
it owes to each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
                   (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under
this section, the Tax Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the
treasurer of state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner
as in division (B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
 
   (D)    (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there
shall be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of
underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to
reasonable cause as described in division (E) of this section. The amount of
the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
                   (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year,
twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount
of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
                   (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year,
forty-five per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
                 (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year,
sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the
amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
                   (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year,
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment.
              (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
            (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered
as taxes collected under sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
 
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
            (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
            (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
one hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.36   Additional penalties

     (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
            (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the Tax
Commissioner, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-
five dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a
month elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and
the date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance,
under this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
            (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically
under sections 124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the Tax Commissioner may
impose a penalty not to exceed the following:
                   (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of
the amount required to be reported on the return;
                   (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per
cent of the amount required to be reported on the return.
            (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
section
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty equal
to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
            (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return
required by sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections 124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
            (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the
reporting or payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required
under sections 124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
            (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund
under section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
 
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner
may adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
 
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.37   Assessments against taxpayer

   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the Tax Commissioner’s
possession.
The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a taxpayer
more than three (3) years after the later of the date the return subject to
assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such time
limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Tax Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The Tax
Commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the Tax
Commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
 
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty (60) days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or
by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer’s
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Tax Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed under
section 5703.60 of the Revised Code.
 
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner’s entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer’s statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.  
Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.  
If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the Tax Commissioner issues the assessment until
the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
 
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Tax Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Tax Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of
the court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this
section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer
assessed or the taxpayer’s legal representative in the manner provided in
section 5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry
with the clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable,
unless the taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance
with division (B) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory
to the Tax Commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not
prejudice the Tax Commissioner’s consideration of the petition for
reassessment.
 
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.  
If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.38   Refund applications

     (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the Tax Commissioner within three (3) years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
 
   (B)    (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of
budget and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax
refund fund created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is
greater than ten dollars but less than that claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall
proceed in accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
            (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Tax
Commissioner shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to
the taxpayer attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be
deducted from the municipal corporation’s next distribution under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
 
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.39   Amended returns

     (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer’s tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Tax Commissioner in such form as the Tax Commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the Tax Commissioner before filing the amended return.
 
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

## 124.40   Examination of records and other documents and persons

     (A)    The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the Tax Commissioner or
a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax
Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
 
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
124.27 to 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the Tax Commissioner’s
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Commissioner determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
 
   (C)    The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person
to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records,
and federal income tax returns in such person’s possession or control. The
person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division
does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
 
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.  
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
