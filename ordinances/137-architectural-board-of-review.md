## 137.01   Board appointments, terms and vacancies

Pursuant to Article VII, Section 9 of the Charter of the Village of Chagrin
Falls, the Architectural Board of Review shall consist of three voting members
and two architect advisors appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by Council for
three-year terms. Vacancies shall be filled for the remainder of unexpired
terms in the same manner as the original appointment. The Mayor shall appoint up
to three alternate members who shall be confirmed by majority vote of the
members of Council for three-year terms. Alternate members shall serve whenever
one or more regular members are unable to hear a particular matter or are
unavailable for a particular meeting. The alternate members shall either be
residents of the Village or registered architects in the State of Ohio,
including architects who were previously licensed for ten years or more who are
retired and are registered as emeritus architects. In the event of the absence
of an architect member or if a conflict arises and such member must not hear a
matter pending before the Architectural Board of Review, then the alternate
member appointment preference for a particular matter or meeting shall be for
any alternate member who is a registered architect.  
(Ord. 2019-33. Passed 4-22-19.)

## 137.02   Membership

The two architect advisors and at least one voting regular member of the
Architectural Board of Review, shall be architects, duly registered, and either
currently licensed or previously licensed to practice architecture in and under
the laws of the State of Ohio, which may include a registered emeritus architect
and shall have been actively engaged in the general practice of architecture as
registered architects in the State of Ohio for a period of not less than three
years prior to their appointment to the Architectural Board of Review, but such
three year period shall not be required to be immediately before the time of
appointment. The architect member(s) and the architect advisors may reside
outside the Village. Two members of the Architectural Board of Review will be
residents and need not be architects. The two architect advisors shall serve in
an advisory capacity only and shall not vote or exercise any authority of the
Village.

## 137.04   Member not to review own work; conflict of interest

No voting member or architect advisor of the Architectural Board of Review shall
participate in the review or approval of any work of which he or she or any
partner or professional associate of his or hers is the author, or in which he

(Ord. 2009-10. Passed 1-26-09.)

## 137.07   Purposes of board

1. _(a)_ The purposes of the Architectural Board of Review are to preserve and
protect the public health, safety and welfare by maintaining the high character
of community development and protecting the real estate within the Municipality
from impairment or destruction of value by regulating, according to proper
architectural principles, the design, use of materials, finished grade lines and
orientation of all new buildings, signs and structures, hereafter erected, and
the moving, alteration, improvement, repair, adding to or razing in full or in
part of the exterior of all existing buildings.

2. _(b)_ Such regulations shall take into consideration the historical and
architectural nature of existing buildings, signs and structures within the
Municipality and the compatibility of proposed changes or proposed new
buildings, signs and structures with such existing buildings, signs and
structures.

3. _(c)_ The Board shall exercise such other powers and duties as may be
established by ordinance of Council.  
(CHTR. Art. VII, Sec. 9; Ord. 2002-13. Passed 2-11-02.)

## 137.08   Review of plans; time limit

1. _(a)_ The Architectural Board of Review shall receive and promptly review and
pass upon all drawings, plans and complaints filed in connection with
applications for building permits in accordance with public rulings and
regulations adopted by the Board.

Failure by the Board to act on any set of plans or specifications within
forty-five days from the date of the Board’s initial consideration of an
application may be considered an approval of such plans and specifications by
the Board. No building permit shall be issued unless plans therefor have been
approved in writing by the Architectural Board of Review or unless no action by
the Board in regard to such plans has been taken within forty-five days of the
date of the Board’s initial consideration of an application.

2. _(b)_ An applicant may request an unofficial review. The unofficial review is
informal and does not entitle the applicant to preliminary or final approval, or
to a building permit.  
(Ord. 2010-08. Passed 4-12-10.)

3. _(c)_ Any applicant seeking required approval from the Architectural Board of
Review for the erection, enlargement and/or alteration of any building in the
Village shall provide the following information to the Architectural Board of
Review for consideration, that they believe support granting approval as
follows:

    1. _(1)_ Specify how, architecturally, the proposed design compares, relates
    or fits with the adjacent, contiguous and neighboring properties.

    2. _(2)_ Specify how the proposed design compares, relates or fits with the
    Village of Chagrin Falls Design Guidelines in terms of (i) architectural
    style, (ii) massing, (iii) proportion, (iv) setback, (v) distance, (vi)
    orientation, (vii) height, (viii) exteriors, (ix) roof elements, (x) windows
    and doors, and (xi) porches and entry features.

4. _(d)_ Any application form utilized by the Chief Administrative Office of the
Village for applications to the Architectural Board of Review shall have an
attachment in an appropriate form determined by the Chief Administrative
Officer, incorporating the criteria set forth in Codified Ordinance Section
137.08(c).
