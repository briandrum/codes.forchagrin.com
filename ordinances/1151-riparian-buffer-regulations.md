## 1151.02   Establishment of buffer area setback and boundary

     The buffer area setback shall be maintained along both sides of stream
channels which have a mean surface width at normal low water of at least ten
feet or greater and wetlands as defined by the Army Corps of Engineers and the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.).  The minimum boundary
of the buffer area setback shall be set at 120 feet in a horizontal plane
outward from the normal low water mark of the stream channel.  It shall be
preserved in its natural state and shall be adjusted outward to include
sensitive areas such as steep slopes, wetlands and wooded areas contiguous to
the stream.   
(Ord. 2019-39.  Passed 8-13-19.)

shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions.
2. {% comment -%} (b) {%- endcomment -%} Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of any buffer area and those of any underlying district, the more
restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the flood plain buffer area
setback shall apply.
3. {% comment -%} (c) {%- endcomment -%} In the event any provision concerning a flood plain buffer area
setback is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or
