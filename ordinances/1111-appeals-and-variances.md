## 1111.01   Intent

The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear any questions or disputes involving the
interpretation of provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code, which shall be
final, unless the matter is referred to the Council as set forth in this
Chapter 1111. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine whether or not a
variance from the strict letter of the Planning and Zoning Code should be
granted. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine whether decisions of
administrative officers, boards or commissions should be affirmed, reversed or
modified on appeal.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1111.02   Jurisdiction

The Board of Zoning Appeals shall adopt such rules and regulations, provided
they are not in conflict with this Planning and Zoning Code or other ordinances
of the Municipality, as may be necessary to carry into effect the powers and
jurisdiction conferred upon it as follows:

1. _(a)_ To hear appeals of final decisions made by the Administrator, or by any
administrative officer, board or commission of the Municipality , on matters
relating to the Planning and Zoning Code, or when directed by other provisions
contained in the Codified Ordinances of the Municipality , for relief from any
order, requirement, decision or determination, including the grant or refusal to
grant a permit, or the revocation of a permit contemplated by this Planning and
Zoning Code; which decision shall be final unless the matter is referred to the
Council pursuant to this Chapter 1111 of the Planning and Zoning Code;
2. _(b)_ To hear and determine applications for variances from the terms provided in
the Planning and Zoning Code subject to the standards provided in the Planning
and Zoning Code;
3. _(c)_ To hear and determine all matters specifically referred to the Board of
Zoning Appeals for determination, such as a determination of district boundary
lines or the interpretation of the Planning and Zoning Code, when the matter is
referred to the Board of Zoning Appeals in the Planning and Zoning Code or other
provisions of the Codified Ordinances.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1111.03   Application for appeals or variances

An appeal shall be considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals only after formal
action or decision has been taken by the Administrator or other Officers,
Boards, or Commissions with regard to an application for a building permit,
zoning certificate, issuance of a stop order, specific referral or some similar
action; provided that:

1. _(a)_ The Administrator or designee shall send notice of such formal action or
decision, by electronic mail, or by depositing a letter with the United States
Postal Service, with postage pre-paid, notifying the aggrieved party who first
made such application, as the case may be, of such formal action or decision.
2. _(b)_ Within ten (10) days of such formal action or decision, an application for
appeal from such formal action or a decision shall be filed with the
Administrator; and when applicable, an application for a variance shall be filed
with the Administrator within such ten (10) day period; and
3. _(c)_ The time period to file an appeal shall commence to run upon the date that
the Administrator or designee sends notice of such formal action or decision, by
electronic mail, or by depositing a letter with the United States Postal
Service, with postage pre-paid, notifying the aggrieved party who first made
such application, as the case may be, of such formal action or decision. The
notice shall be sent to the e-mail address or residence or business address
designated by the applicant when filing an application for a permit, if any.
Failure of the applicant to receive such notice shall not be a basis for tolling
or extending the time period to file an appeal.
4. _(d)_ Prior to filing an application for a variance from the Board of Zoning
Appeals, for the erection, enlargement and/or alteration of a building in the
Municipality, the applicant shall be required to first obtain preliminary plan
approval from the Architectural Board of Review for such building.
5. _(e)_ In the event an aggrieved party was provided with incorrect written
information from the Administrator, Building Inspector, Secretary of the
Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board of Zoning Appeals, or other Village
official with authority to provide information on appeal deadlines, as to the
date when an appeal from formal action taken pursuant to this Section must be
filed, and as a result the aggrieved party is unable to timely file an appeal
from such action, the aggrieved party shall have a period of ten (10) days from
the date that they discovered the correct deadline to file an appeal, but not to
exceed twenty (20) days after formal action has been taken from which an appeal
must ordinarily be filed with the Administrator, by filing the appropriate
application and information as required by the Planning and Zoning Code.  
In the event an appeal is filed pursuant to this Section, the Building Inspector
shall issue an order to the permit recipient to discontinue all work authorized
under such permit in accordance with Section 1307.10, during the pendency of the
appeal. Further work performed under such permit, during the pendency of the
appeal, shall be deemed to be in violation of this provision.  
(Ord. 2021-20. Passed 5-24-21.)

## 1111.04   Notices

The Board of Zoning Appeals, upon receiving an application for a variance, or an
appeal from the decision of the Administrator, Architectural Board of Review or
other administrative entity, shall hold a public hearing. Notice of a public
hearing shall be in accordance with Section 1109.09 of the Planning and Zoning
Code.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1111.05   Meetings, quorum and vote

1. _(a)_ Hearing of Appeals and Variances. The Board shall allow any interested party
to submit admissible evidence or testimony to the Board, provided that all
testimony shall be submitted under oath, and all interested parties shall be
permitted to cross-examine witnesses and present their positions, arguments and
contentions. In the event the Board determines that evidence or testimony is not
admissible, the Board shall permit the proffer of such evidence in a manner
which allows for the creation of a complete record.
2. _(b)_ Quorum and Vote. A majority of the members of the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In each case a motion
or motions shall be made to grant the relief requested. Such motions may be made
and seconded by members who are opposed to the motion. The affirmative vote of
three members of the Board shall be necessary for any official decision. Failure
to receive three (3) affirmative votes will constitute a denial of the motion
pending before the Board and will result in an affirmance of the prior
administrative action being reviewed, or the requested variance(s) will be
considered denied. Prior to voting on a motion, Board members shall state facts
which support their decision. Such facts shall become the basis for Conclusions
of Fact by the Board. Members may state their agreement with a prior
articulation of facts and need not restate all facts supporting their decision
prior to voting on the motion.
3. _(c)_ Decisions and Conclusions of Fact. After the public hearing, the Board shall
make its determination which shall include a decision and conclusions of fact.
The Board shall also prepare its record in accordance with Section 1111.06 of
this Chapter, when the matter will be referred to Council for review of the
decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1111.06   Record of decision

1. _(a)_ The Board of Zoning Appeals, upon making any decision contemplated by this
Chapter 1111, shall have its secretary immediately notify, in writing, the Clerk
of Council of such action and notify each member of Council, using the
electronic mail address they have provided to the Clerk of Council for receiving
notices of Council business, or if none, by personal delivery, of the action
taken by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
2. _(b)_ Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written notification by the
Clerk of Council from the Board of Zoning Appeals, of each decision made by such
Board, any three (3) or more members of Council may, in writing, with copies
provided to each member of Council at their electronic mail address, or if none
by personal delivery, in any form or manner such Council members deem
appropriate, request that the Clerk of Council set a public hearing to review
the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, in which case the Council shall
receive testimony, and consider the evidence presented to Council, which shall
also include the record to be prepared and provided by the Board of Zoning
Appeals to Council, including its their decision and conclusions of fact, and
the decision of Council shall be final in regard to any exception, variance,
interpretation or review of orders of administrative officials, boards or
agencies of the Municipality, and a majority of Council shall be required to
either affirm or reverse the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
3. _(c)_ Notice of the hearing by Council shall be given as provided in Section 1109.09 of the Planning and Zoning Code, including to the applicant before the
Board of Zoning Appeals that is the subject of the review by Council.
4. _(d)_ If three (3) or more members of Council failed to request a hearing within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of notification of the decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals by the Clerk of Council, the decision of the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall be final.
5. _(e)_ The notice to be provided by at least three (3) members of Council to have
such Board of Zoning Appeals’ decision reviewed by Council shall provide the
name of the applicant, the address of the property that is the subject of the
exception or variance, and which action(s) of the Board of Zoning Appeals will
be reviewed by Council.
6. _(f)_ Clerk of Council shall give notice of the hearing of the request for review
by the three (3) or more Council members to the applicant, the law director and
the secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1111.07   Reasons for granting variances

1. _(a)_ The Board of Zoning Appeals, and in the case of a review of the Board of
Zoning Appeals’ decision by Council, may, in specific cases, vary, modify or
waive the application of certain provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code,
after making findings of fact setting forth the reasons therefor, in order that
the public health, safety, convenience, comfort and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice done.
2. _(b)_ Variances shall not be granted for uses not permitted in the zoning district
applicable to the property, unless a literal application of this Planning and
Zoning Code would result in an unnecessary hardship that:
   1. Was not self-created;
   2. Is due to unique conditions existing on the property;
   3. The property cannot be used for the purposes for which it is zoned;
   4. Will not violate the spirit of the Planning and Zoning Code;
   5. Is the minimum necessary to avoid the unnecessary hardship; and,
   6. Results from special conditions unique to the property being reviewed.
3. _(c)_ Area variances may be granted on the basis of a finding of a practical
difficulty. While no single factor controls in the determination of a practical
difficulty, the factors to be considered and weighed include, but are not
limited to:
   1. Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether there can
   be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
   2. Whether the variance is substantial;
   3. Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially
   altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a substantial detriment
   as a result of the variance;
   4. Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental
   services;
   5. Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of the
   zoning restriction;
   6. Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be obviated through
   some method other than a variance;
   7. Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be
   observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and,
   8. Whether the variance is based on circumstances that are self- created or
   exist as a result of actions of the property owner.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1111.08   Variances for yards; supplemental standards

The Board of Zoning Appeals, or in the case of a review of its decision by
Council, the Council, may permit variations of yard regulations in a residential
district for a lot of record, provided the Board of Zoning Appeals, or Council,
as the case may be, finds that privacy will not be impaired, and that light and
ventilation will be adequate on such lot and not unduly diminished on adjoining
lots.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1111.09   Landscape and protective features

The Board of Zoning Appeals, or in the case of a review of its decision by
Council, the Council, upon making various determinations, shall endeavor to
protect adjoining property, to assure safety of pedestrians and convenience of
traffic movements within the area in question, and may require the provision of
curbs, guard rails, walls, fences or other landscape or protective features, to
further the purposes of this Planning and Zoning Code.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1111.10   Action by council

1. _(a)_ When required to review a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, pursuant
to Section 1111.06 of the Zoning Code, each case shall be considered by Council
upon the record created by the Board of Zoning Appeals, and as supplemented by
the evidence presented by the applicant, the Municipality or anyone else
interested in the proceeding.
2. _(b)_ Council shall apply the laws of the Municipality to the facts of the case as
those facts are contained in the record which was created by the Board of Zoning
Appeals or supplemented in the proceedings before Council, where testimony shall
be taken under oath and subject to issuance of subpoenas upon request, and such
testimony shall be subject to cross examination whether it be presented at the
Board of Zoning Appeals or Council.
3. _(c)_ In the event the Council does not follow the decision of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, Council shall make its own decision and shall adopt Conclusions of Fact
which support its decision, and which are found in the record.
4. _(d)_ At any time prior to a final decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, or
Council, the applicant may withdraw the application. Receipt of notice of the
withdrawal of an appeal or an application for a variance or exception, at any
time prior to final action by the Board of Zoning Appeals, or Council, as the
case may be, shall reinstate the prior decision of any administrative officer or
body and the appeal or application for a variance or exception shall be treated
as though it had not been submitted, except that the applicant will not be
entitled to the return of any fees, deposits or costs required in this Planning
and Zoning Code.
5. _(e)_ After reviewing the Board of Zoning Appeals’ decision, Council may affirm,
affirm and modify or reverse the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals by a
majority vote of all of its members.
6. _(f)_ Immediately following Council’s decision, notice of such decision shall be
mailed to the applicant and all interested parties who personally appeared
before Council to support affirmance or reversal of the decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals.    
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19; Ord. 2021-20. Passed 5-24-21.)

decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to Section 1111.06 of this
Planning and Zoning Code, shall commence to run upon the date that the
Administrator or his designee sends notice, by electronic mail, or by depositing
a letter with the United States Postal Service, with postage pre- paid,
notifying the aggrieved party who first filed an appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals of the final decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Council, as
the case may be. The notice shall be sent to the e-mail address or residence or
business address designated by the applicant when filing an application for
relief from the Board of Zoning Appeals. Failure of the applicant to receive
