## 1131.06   Distances between buildings and uses

In a Retirement Living District, land and structures shall be developed and

1. _(a)_ Definitions and Measurement Standards. The following definitions and
measurement standards shall apply to terms used in this section.
    1. _(1)_ Main wall. Any exterior wall(s) of a residential building
containing the principal windows of a living, dining or sleeping room or rooms.
    2. _(2)_ Secondary wall. Any exterior wall(s) of a residential building,
other than a main wall, containing minor windows of a dining or sleeping room,
principal or minor windows of a kitchen or bathroom, or no windows.
    3. _(3)_ Overlapping walls. A wall of one building shall be considered as
overlapping a wall of a second building when perpendicular lines extended from
that wall intersect the second wall.
    4. _(4)_ Length of overlap. The "length of overlap" shall be considered as
the length of the portion of one wall from which perpendicular lines will
intersect a second wall. In determining the length of overlap, the minimum
possible overlap shall be used for computation.
    5. _(5)_ Facing walls. Although more than one set of walls may be
"overlapping" in the relationship between two buildings, only one set of two
walls shall be considered "facing". Facing walls shall be those two overlapping
walls for which the length of overlap is the greater.
2. _(b)_ Schedule of Distances. The minimum distance between walls of main
buildings and other walls or uses shall be as set forth in the following
schedule:
Building Wall               Other Wall or Use          Minimum Distance (feet)

and maintained in accordance with the following design regulations and
standards.

1. _(a)_ Building Design. Retirement Living Center. The maximum length of any
main or accessory building wall shall be 100 feet. However, building length may
extend a maximum of 200 feet, provided that walls are offset or aligned at
angles as approved by the Architectural Board of Review.
2. _(b)_ Building Design: Attached Single-Family. In order to enhance privacy
and to reduce the apparent mass of the buildings, the alignment of attached
single family buildings should be varied and the facades of not more than every
two dwelling units shall be offset by at least sixteen inches. No more than
eight units shall be located in one building.
3. _(c)_ Building Design: General. To reduce the apparent mass of the
building’s variations in such building elements as facade, width, color,
exterior materials, and roof lines shall be deemed desirable. Parallel
arrangements of buildings should be avoided. However, uniformity in design is
not expressly prohibited.
4. _(d)_ Site Design. Retirement Living residential developments shall be
designed to complement the topography of the land in order to utilize natural
contours, economize in the construction of utilities, reduce required grading
and maximize the conservation of trees, watercourses and other natural
features. Natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site
shall be integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the
arrangements of buildings, open spaces and accessory uses.
5. _(e)_ Modifications to Area, Yard and Setback Requirements. With respect to
properties of irregular shape, or unusual topography the Planning and Zoning
Commission may modify requirements regarding areas, yards, setbacks and
distances between uses if compliance with these requirements is either clearly
infeasible or contrary to compliance with the design regulations and standards
of this section. However, the maximum permitted density shall not be increased
by reason of this provision. Applicants shall first seek modifications
permitted under this section prior to filing an application as set forth in
Section 1111.03 for a variance for areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses. 
6. _(f)_ Common Open Space. As required in Section 1131.03(f), at least 500 square feet of land per dwelling unit shall be

or water of such condition, size and shape as to be usable for active
recreation and/or scenic enjoyment as appropriate to the site, the surrounding
area, and the expected resident population. Such area shall contain no
structures other than those related to recreational use and shall not include
roads or parking areas.
        2. _(B)_ Setback areas shall be excluded in the computation of common open
space.
        3. _(C)_ Consideration shall be given to the arrangement and location of
common open space to take advantage of physical characteristics of the site and
to place common open space within easy access and view of dwelling units.
Common open space shall not be separated from the development by existing
roads.
        4. _(D)_ Common open space shall not be depleted, reduced in size or
converted to any other use.
    2. _(2)_ Ownership and maintenance.
        1. _(A)_ The applicant shall submit copies of the proposed documents which
provide for the permanent preservation of open space at the time of application
for development. No application shall be approved until such documents are
acceptable to the Municipality and the Law Director in form and content.
        2. _(B)_ Such common open space, including any recreational facilities
proposed to be constructed in such space, shall be clearly delineated on the
site plan together with descriptive data as to the methods to be employed to
preserve and maintain such open space.
        3. _(C)_ In the event the open space is owned in common by more than one
owner directly or indirectly, a non-profit association shall be incorporated
under the laws of the State of Ohio and such association shall be the owner in
unencumbered fee simple title. 
        4. _(D)_ All common open space shown on the site plan must be subject to
legally enforceable declarations and restrictions. Such declarations and
restrictions shall grant enforcement rights to the Municipality as a third-
party beneficiary, and shall be reviewed by and must obtain approval of the Law
Director before final approval for development will be granted., The
declarations and restrictions shall grant enforcement rights to the
Municipality as a third-party beneficiary, and shall be reviewed by and must
obtain the approval of the Law Director before final approval for development
will be granted.
7. _(g)_ Pedestrian Circulation. Each Retirement Living residential development
shall be served by a comprehensive walkway system adequately separated from
vehicular circulation, connecting residential buildings, parking areas,
recreation areas and health center buildings.
8. _(h)_ Utility Equipment. All utility lines serving a Retirement Living
residential development shall be located underground. All rooftop mechanical
equipment shall be enclosed in a manner which complements the architectural
style of the building on which it is located.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1131.08   Off-street parking regulations

     In addition to the applicable regulations of Chapter 1141, the following parking regulations shall apply to attached single-family
developments in a Retirement Living District.

1. _(a)_ Common Parking Areas. In attached single-family developments, a
minimum of one-half (0.5) off-street parking space per dwelling unit shall be
provided in unenclosed common parking areas distributed throughout the
developments in a manner providing convenient access to all dwelling units. 
This requirement shall be in addition to the parking requirements of Chapter 1141.
2. _(b)_ Garages. In attached single-family developments, each garage shall be
provided for the exclusive use of a single dwelling unit and shall be attached
to the residential structure which contains that unit. Such garages may be
attached to one another at side walls in order to improve design.
3. _(c)_ Prohibited Activity.  The rebuilding, overhauling or dismantling of an
automotive vehicle or the storage of motor or body parts in an open yard is
prohibited. The outside parking and storage of recreational vehicles is
prohibited.
