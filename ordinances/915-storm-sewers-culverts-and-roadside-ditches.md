any construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or removal of any roadside
drainage ditch, tree lawn  or other portion of a dedicated street or highway

regrading or installing of storm sewers and basins, or any alteration of the
course or grade of any roadside drainage ditch, tree lawn or other portion of a
