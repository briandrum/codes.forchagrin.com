facilities or structures that are encountered during the work of construction,
shall be carefully protected, at the cost of the permit holder, to prevent

(Ord. 1985-8. Passed 2-25-85.)
6. {% comment -%} (f) {%- endcomment -%} When the material excavated from a trench is suitable for backfill, in

foregoing, the original sod may be carefully removed and stockpiled and after
the trench backfill is compacted, the sod may be replaced with topsoil to be
placed under sod, then seed added if necessary, and rolled so that the lawn, as
disturbed, shall be equal to the original. At its option, the Village may
require sod instead of seeding with the permitter responsible for watering with
a frequency to insure healthy growth.
8. {% comment -%} (h) {%- endcomment -%} Where the trench lies within driveway, parking or other areas subject
to traffic, the backfill material shall be premium backfill or other suitable
