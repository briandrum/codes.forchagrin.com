## 1146.01   Intent

     In order to maintain and enhance the distinctive historic character of the
Municipality these regulations are established to achieve, among others, the
following objectives:

1. _(a)_ To foster a sense of community identification; and civic pride by
preserving structures which reflect periods and events in the history of the
community and its region;
2. _(b)_ To stimulate the local economy by encouraging investment in historic
resources and protecting the community assets which support current retail
activity;
3. _(c)_ To protect property values within the Municipality by preventing
environmental changes which diminish the area’s unique historic character;
4. _(d)_ To recognize the importance of preserving structures that contribute
to the traditional village land use pattern; and
5. _(e)_ To avoid demolition of or incompatible alterations to historic
structures.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1146.02   Applicability

1. _(a)_ No building or other structure in the Municipality shall be erected,
altered in exterior construction or appearance, enlarged, moved or demolished
unless such action complies with the provisions of this chapter. Applicability
of these provisions is limited to structures of historic significance and sites
in proximity to such structures. See Section 1146.05 for an explanation of terms.
2. _(b)_ The painting of buildings and structures shall not be governed by
these regulations. For the purposes of this Chapter a structure shall include
building or a portion thereof.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1146.03   Administrative procedures

     The following procedures are established to govern the processing of
applications for building permits and other municipal authorizations in
accordance with the regulations of this chapter.

1. _(a)_ Mandatory Referral.
    1. _(1)_ As directed by Section 1109.05(b)(1), all requests for building permits shall be referred to the
Architectural Board of Review for a determination of compliance with  this
Chapter. The Architectural Board of Review may obtain the assistance of an
expert in historic architecture to assist it in determining whether a proposed
project satisfies the requirements of this chapter. 
    2. _(2)_ All requests for demolition of a structure or portion of a
structure which is more than fifty (50) years old shall be accompanied by a
deposit of five hundred dollars ($500.00). All requests to make an addition to
or alteration of a structure or portion of a structure which is more than fifty
(50) years old shall be accompanied by a deposit of three hundred dollars
($300.00). As provided below, the request shall be referred to the
Architectural Board of Review with a recommendation from the Administration as
to whether or not the structure is a Historically Significant Property. The
Architectural Board of Review shall apply the standards set forth in Section 1146.06 hereof to determine whether or not demolition is permitted.
        1. _(A)_ Advice of Expert on Historic Significance.  When an applicant
requests a permit to demolish a structure or portion thereof that is more than
fifty (50) years old, the Administrator  shall engage the assistance of an
expert in the field of the history of architecture, who shall make a
recommendation to the Architectural Board of Review regarding whether or not
the structure is an Historically Significant Property, as defined by Section 1146.05  of this Chapter. The expert shall be paid out of the deposit made
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) hereof, and the remaining funds from such deposit,
if any, shall be returned to the applicant.
        2. _(B)_ Advice of Expert on Economic Feasibility. If, in reviewing a
request for demolition, a majority of the Architectural Board of Review, by
motion, requests the advice of an expert to assist in the analysis of
determining whether or not the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of an
Historically Significant Property is Economically Feasible, the Administrator 
shall determine whether the  Municipality  should engage an expert at
Municipality  expense, to provide such advice.
        3. _(C)_ Advice of Expert on Additions and Alterations. When an applicant
requests a permit to add to, or in any material way (other than painting) alter
the exterior of, any structure that is more than fifty (50) but less than one
hundred (100) years old, the Administrator  shall engage the assistance of an
expert in the field of the history of architecture, who shall make a
recommendation to the Architectural Board of Review regarding whether or not
the structure is a Historically Significant Property, as defined by Section 1146.05 of this Chapter, and whether the proposed addition or alteration is
Compatible with the existing structure and other historic structures
in proximity thereto. When the structure, or a portion thereof has been
determined by the Municipality to be at least 100 years old, it shall be
presumed to be a Historically Significant Property and the advice of an expert
shall not be required unless the Administrator needs such assistance to
determine the age of the structure, or a portion thereof. The Administrator
shall obtain the expert opinion to determine if the proposed material change
will have an adverse effect on the Historical Significance of the structure.
The expert shall be paid out of the deposit made pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)
hereof, and the remaining funds from such deposit shall be returned to the
applicant.
    3. _(3)_ Where an applicant for a building permit proposes to change the
existing grade of a lot by more than three (3) inches, the Architectural Board
of Review shall review, in accordance with Section 1109.05 and this Chapter 1146 of this Planning and Zoning Code, such change to ensure that the proposed
building elevations and site grading are compatible with contiguous property
and that the proposed building meets the standards set forth in Section 1115.04, failing which the Architectural Review Board shall deny approval of
such grade change.
2. _(b)_ Approval/Disapproval. The Architectural Board of Review shall either
approve, approve with modification or disapprove the application in accordance
with the review and approval procedures set forth in Section 1109.05. In conjunction with a motion to grant the request of the applicant,
the members of the Architectural Board of Review shall identify facts which
have been presented to the Architectural Board of Review which the members
believe are supportive of their decision in the case. It is not sufficient for
the Architectural Board of Review to identify the ultimate fact to be
determined (e.g., Compatibility or Historic Significance), but the members of
the Architectural Board of Review, when stating or voting on the motion to
grant the request of the applicant(s), shall identify the specific facts
presented in the matter before them which cause them to reach their conclusion
and support their vote; if a member states facts with which a second member
agrees, the second member may indicate so, generally, and/or may distinguish
his or her findings relative to facts previously stated. The facts identified
and agreed upon by a majority of the Architectural Board of Review shall be
deemed the Conclusions of Fact of the Architectural Board of Review; provided
that if no majority vote is obtained, the motion shall be deemed defeated and
facts adopted by those who voted in opposition to the motion shall be deemed
the Conclusions of Fact of the Architectural Board of Review.
3. _(c)_ Notifications.  The Architectural Board of Review shall notify the
applicant in writing of the time and location of its meeting. Subsequent to
that meeting, the Architectural Board of Review shall notify the applicant in
writing of its determination, stating reasons for a determination of
disapproval.
4. _(d)_ Appeal. Any interested party may appeal the determination of the
Architectural Board of Review to the Board of Zoning Appeals, in accordance
with the terms of Chapter 1111 of the Codified Ordinances.
5. _(e)_ Mandatory Stay of Demolition. No permit to demolish shall be issued
by the Administrator for thirty (30) days following the final administrative
adjudication by the Municipality, and in the event the appellate court(s)
reviewing the matter issue a stay, no demolition permit shall be issued pending
the final outcome of the administrative appeal.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1146.04   Standards of review

In its review of applications, the Architectural Board of Review shall:

1. _(a)_ Consider the historical and architectural nature of existing
buildings, signs and structures within the Municipality and the compatibility
of proposed changes or proposed new buildings, signs and structures with such
existing buildings, signs and structures;
2. _(b)_ Consider the design standards of Section 1146.08; and
3. _(c)_ Follow the guidelines set forth below:
    1. _(1)_ Preservation of features.  The distinguishing original qualities or
character of a Historically Significant Property shall not be destroyed.
Removal or alteration of historic material or distinctive architectural
features shall be avoided. 
    2. _(2)_ Replacement of features. Consistent with the concept of
responsible property maintenance, deteriorated or damaged architectural
features shall be repaired rather than replaced. In the event that the
Architectural Board of Review determines that replacement of architectural
features on a Historically Significant Property is necessary, the new material
should closely match the material being replaced in composition, design, color,
texture and other visual qualities.
    3. _(3)_ Compatibility.  Alterations, additions and new development shall be
compatible in scale, material and character with the design of the subject
property and any structure more than fifty (50) years old in Proximity to the
subject property. New structures may be constructed in accordance with a
different architectural style than Historically Significant Properties.
    4. _(4)_ Contemporary design. All structures shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations, additions and new development which
have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall
not be required. Conversely, compatible contemporary design shall not be
prohibited or discouraged except where such design would clearly detract from
the architectural unity of an ensemble or group of Historically Significant
Properties.
    5. _(5)_ Cleaning.  The surface cleaning of Historically Significant
Property shall be undertaken by the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and
other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall
not be permitted.
    6. _(6)_ Accessory structures. Fences, walkways, street lights, and other
accessory structures located in Proximity to structures more than (50) years
old shall be compatible in design with the character of such properties.
    7. _(7)_ Signs. In addition to meeting the requirements of Chapter 1143, signs located on or in proximity to Historically Significant Properties
shall be compatible in color, material, placement and character with the
architectural style of such Properties.
4. _(d)_ Apply the following burdens of proof when evaluating applications
under this Chapter:
    1. _(1)_ Any person asserting that a structure is an Historically
Significant Property bears the burden of proving the assertion by clear and
convincing evidence; provided, that any structure which is more than one
hundred (100) years old shall be presumed to be an Historically Significant
Property, and any party asserting that such structure is not a Historically
Significant Property shall bear the burden of proving the same by clear and
convincing  evidence.
    2. _(2)_ If new construction is proposed, the design of the new construction
shall be permitted unless it is proven, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the new building is not compatible with any structure more than fifty (50)
years old that is in Proximity to the proposed new building. Nothing herein
shall limit the authority of the Architectural Board of Review to require a
property owner to adhere to proper architectural principles in the design, use
of materials, finished grade lines and orientation of the construction of the
new building or to make recommendations to the applicant regarding the proposed
design.
    3. _(3)_ If an addition to, or exterior alteration of, an existing
Historically Significant Property is proposed, the applicant shall bear the
burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the proposed addition
or alteration is consistent with the historically significant features of the
structure such that the historically significant features shall be preserved.
    4. _(4)_ If a party proposes the demolition of a Historically Significant
Property, that party bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing
evidence, that the demolition is permissible pursuant to Section 1146.06 hereof.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1146.05   Definitions

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning given
herein:

1. _(a)_ A "Historically Significant Property" means (i) any structure which is
more than one  hundred (100) years old, or, (ii) any structure that is fifty
(50) years old and:
    1. _(1)_ Is listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior); or preliminarily
determined by the Ohio Historic Site Preservation Advisory Board as meeting the
requirements for individual listings on the National Register; or
    2. _(2)_ Is certified or preliminarily determined by the Ohio Historic Site
Preservation Advisory Board as contributing to the historical significance of a
registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Ohio
Historic Site Preservation Advisory Board to qualify as a registered historic
district; or
    3. _(3)_ Consistent with the criteria used to determine National Register
eligibility, possesses one or more of the following attributes:
        1. _(A)_ Is associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of Municipality history; or
        2. _(B)_ Is associated with the lives of persons significant in the
Municipality’s past; or
        3. _(C)_ Is a structure which:
            1. _(1)_ Embodies the distinctive local characteristics of a type,
period or method of construction; or
            2. _(2)_ Represents the work of a local Master as defined herein; or
            3. _(3)_ Possesses high artistic values; or
        4. _(D)_ Has yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in
the prehistory or history of the Municipality.
2. _(b)_ "Compatible" for the purposes of this chapter means that a design does
not materially and adversely impact the economic or historical value of a
Historically Significant Property.
3. _(c)_ "Proximity" for the purpose of determining compatibility of design
pursuant to Section 1146.04 means the potential for one property, by virtue of its location, to
materially and adversely affect an Historically Significant Property.
4. _(d)_ "Economically Feasible" means that the costs of the necessary repair
and  rehabilitation  of a Historically Significant Property, when combined with
the market value  of the land upon which the Historically Significant  Property
resides, do not exceed the  market value of the real property after the
necessary repair and  rehabilitation  of the Historically Significant Property
has been completed,  based on the reasonable expectations in the marketplace
for comparably aged and constructed homes by an amount beyond what a willing
and reasonably prudent buyer would agree to pay for a Historically Significant
Property in that area of the Municipality.
5. _(e)_ "Preservation" means the act or process of applying measures necessary
to sustain the existing form, integrity and material of a Historically
Significant Property.
6. _(f)_ "Restoration" means the returning of a historically significant
building to its original condition or to its condition at a specifically
identified time in its history as it has evolved, based on supporting visual
and documentary evidence and physical analysis of the property. The intent of
restoration is to accurately restore the character-defining historical elements
of the property to their original or selected later date appearance when it
achieved its historical importance. Conjectural restoration is not acceptable.
7. _(g)_ "Repair" means the fixing or mending of a building that has suffered
natural or man-made damage due, for example, to wind, water, fire, vandalism or
long-term failure to properly maintain it. Repair does not imply, nor does it
encourage restoration, although it may become part of the process for a
building undergoing restoration.
8. _(h)_ "Rehabilitation" means the renovation of a building, in its present
condition, for continued use, or its adaptation to a new use. To meet the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, the owner must retain
the surviving historically-important, character-defining components of the
building but is not required to restore it to its original historical
appearance or configuration, which may have changed over the years.
9. _(i)_ "Reconstruction" means the building of a replica of a structure, or
portion thereof, that has been destroyed, based upon supporting visual and
documentary evidence and, possibly surviving fragments. This technique is
rarely used and is usually confined to archaeological sites. 
10. _(j)_ "Master" means a figure of generally recognized greatness in a field,
a known craftsman of consummate skill, or an anonymous craftsman whose work is
distinguishable from others by its characteristic style and quality. The
property must express a particular phase in the development of the master’s
career, an aspect of the master’s work, or a particular idea or theme in the
master’s craft.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1146.06   Demolition and moving

1. _(a)_ Demolition Prohibited; Exceptions.  The demolition of a Historically
Significant Property shall not be permitted unless one of the following
conditions exist:
    1. _(1)_ Demolition has been ordered by the Administrator for public safety
because of an unsafe or dangerous condition that constitutes an emergency.
    2. _(2)_ The owner demonstrates that the Historically Significant Property
is either not habitable or otherwise not safe; or the Repair or Rehabilitation 
of the structure is not Economically Feasible and the property’s condition did
not result from damage which has been purposefully caused to the property, or
allowed to occur due to the  neglect of the owner or  previous owners with the
likely  intention of making the Repair or  Rehabilitation of the structure not
Economically Feasible. No permit to demolish will be permitted under this
paragraph (a)(2) or (3) hereof unless the owner or owner’s representative
obtains final approval from the Architectural Board of Review for the structure
(s) which will replace the structure to be demolished.
    3. _(3)_ The owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Architectural
Board of Review that denial of the demolition is inconsistent with a legitimate
interest in the health, safety and welfare of the Municipality.
    4. _(4)_ The demolition request is for an inappropriate addition or a
portion of a structure that is not historically significant, and, the
demolition will not adversely affect those parts of the structure that are
found to be a Historically Significant Property as determined by the
Architectural Board of Review.
   
2. _(b)_ Moving.  No Historically Significant Property may be moved from its
current location unless the Architectural Board of Review determines that the
moving of the structure will not materially and adversely impact the historical
character of the structures more than 50 years old in Proximity.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1146.07   Maintenance requirements

1. _(a)_ Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or delay the
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of a structure or feature which has
been ordered by the Administrator upon certification of an unsafe condition
constituting an emergency.
2. _(b)_ Similarly, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to govern or
restrict routine maintenance activities, which do not represent alterations in
exterior appearance.
3. _(c)_ The owner of any structure, even if vacant and uninhabited, shall
provide sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to ensure its
perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by deterioration. This provision
shall be in addition to all other applicable provisions of the Building Code.
