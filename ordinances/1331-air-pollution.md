## 1331.01   Scope; compliance required

1. _(a)_ Scope. This chapter is designed to provide minimum standards for the
abatement of pollution of the air resources of the Municipality.
2. _(b)_ Violations. No person, firm or corporation shall commit any act in
violation of this chapter or omit to do any act required of such person, firm
or corporation by any of the provisions as set forth in this chapter or any
amendments thereof.  
(Ord. 1968-740. Passed 10-1-68.)

## 1331.02   Objectives

Ambient air quality standards are designed to protect people from the
adverse effects of air pollution and are further intended to promote maximum
comfort and enjoyment of their respective properties.

It is recognized that ambient air quality objectives do vary with the land
use. Inasmuch as the Municipality represents essentially a residential area,
the standards as set forth here reflect this fact.  
(Ord. 1968-740. Passed 10-1-68.)

## 1331.03   Enforcement

1. _(a)_ Permit to Operate. On and after October 15, 1968, all devices or
installations which come under the jurisdiction of this chapter are subject to
inspection and licensing. It shall be deemed a violation of this chapter to
operate such device or installation without an official permit issued by the
Building Inspector.  
No permit may be issued to operate a sealed device.
2. _(b)_ Violation of Chapter. Whenever any device is found to be operated in
violation of this chapter or installed in such a manner that it cannot be
operated in conformity with this chapter, the Environmental Control Officer
shall issue written notice to the owner or operator of such device outlining
the violations involved. The Environmental Control Officer shall stipulate a
specific time limitation for corrective measures to be instituted. Failure to
act upon this notice within the time limit granted shall be cause for the
Environmental Control Officer to seal such device and order operation to be
discontinued immediately.
3. _(c)_ Sealed Devices. It shall be a violation of this chapter to operate any
sealed device or for anyone other than the Environmental Control Officer, or an
authorized member of the Environmental Control Board, to remove such seal.
4. _(d)_ Denial of Admittance. No person shall deny admittance during business
hours to any officer charged with enforcement of this chapter or in any way
interfere with any officer in the performance of his duties under this chapter.
5. _(e)_ Right to Appeal. The right to appeal any order or decision made under
or pursuant to this chapter shall be granted by law.  
(Ord. 1968-740. Passed 10-1-68.)

## 1331.04   Permits, time limitations; inspections

1. _(a)_ Permit Requirements. No person shall erect, construct, alter or
install any combustion or any other device or parts thereof governed by the
provisions of this chapter in any building or other structure or on any
premises until a permit has been secured from the Building Inspector pursuant
to a written application therefor, upon forms furnished by the Building
Inspector. Each application for a permit shall be accompanied by such drawings,
specifications and data as are required to verify that the proposed work will
conform to the provisions of this chapter. Such drawings, specifications and
data shall be approved by the Environmental Control Officer before such permit
is issued.
2. _(b)_ Time Limitations. If construction for which a permit has been issued
is not started within six months of the permit date, the permit shall be null
and void and a new application must be submitted.
3. _(c)_ Inspection. The Environmental Control Officer shall inspect every
combustion device, incinerator and installation within the jurisdiction of this
chapter not less than once every twelve months. A certificate of operation is
to be issued if the installation is acceptable. If it is in violation of this
chapter, written notice shall be given to the operator with a specific time
limit to correct whatever renders such installation unacceptable. The time
limit shall be set by Council upon the recommendation of the Environmental
Control Officer.
4. _(d)_ Exceptions. Nothing in subsections (a) through (c) hereof shall be
deemed to apply to heating devices and incinerators serving fewer than three
family dwelling units.  
(Ord. 1968-740. Passed 10-1-68.)

## 1331.05   Stack and vent emissions

The following limitations are to apply for emissions from any stack or vent
within the Municipality:

1. _(a)_ Smoke.
Ringleman                  Combustion Devices
Chart No.   Incinerators   Other Than Incinerators
1           No limitations No limitations
2           Not allowed    10 minutes any 1 hour period
3           Not allowed    5 minutes any 8 hour period
4 & 5       Not allowed    Not allowed
Exceptions:
    1. _(1)_ During equipment breakdown.
    2. _(2)_ During initial firing from complete shutdown.
2. _(b)_ Gases, Fumes and Other Pollution. No emission of poisonous, obnoxious,
pungent or ill-smelling gases, fumes or other air pollutants are permitted
from any stack or from any other source in the Municipality so as to cause a
nuisance or create a health hazard.
3. _(c)_ Dust or Fumes. No emission with color other than black is to be
discharged in excess of a No. 2 Ringleman Chart density or opacity. An
exception is in the event the emission represents water vapor in its pure form.
4. _(d)_ Settleable Particulates. This includes materials classified as fly
ash, soot, dust or other unclassified particulate matter. The maximum allowable
discharge from combustion devices shall be:

Incinerators            0.20 lbs./1,000 lbs. stack gas
Other than incinerators 0.65 lbs./1,000 lbs. stack gas
The foregoing requirements are to be calculated in accordance with American
Society of Mechanical Engineers PTC-21-1941 procedure. In each case stack gases
are to be adjusted to fifty percent excess air.  
(Ord. 1968-740. Passed 10-1-68.)

## 1331.06   Nuisances other than stack emissions

1. _(a)_ Dust. No person, firm or corporation having charge or management of
any building, premises, industrial establishment, coal yard, brick yard,
factory or other place of business, by himself, his agent or employee, shall
cause, suffer or allow the handling, conveying, storing or accumulation of any
coal, ashes, cinders, building material, dust, refuse or other material, in
such manner that dust or other emanations may escape and become a nuisance,
beyond his own property line at normally occupied levels.
2. _(b)_ Open Fires. No owner, occupant or person in charge, by himself, his
agent or employee, shall cause, suffer or allow the burning of paper, wood or
combustible refuse, waste material, motor vehicles or any part thereof, within

if the equipment is properly standardized immediately prior to and following
the test period.
3. _(c)_ Authorization of Testing. When the Environmental Control Officer has
cause to believe that an emission from fuel-burning equipment (or any other
device) violates Section 1331.05 he shall notify the owner of the equipment and set a time for a
hearing, which hearing shall be set not less than ten nor more than twenty days
from the time of notification.  
Following the hearing, the Environmental Control Officer may further require
the owner to make or cause to be made such tests as may be necessary to
determine if the device is operating within the limits of Section 1331.05.
4. _(d)_ Test Procedures. The Environmental Control Officer and owner shall
have an opportunity to witness the tests and the results of the same shall be
made available to both parties. All test procedures shall be made and computed
in accordance with the A.S.M.E. PTC-21-1941 or in accordance with procedures
mutually agreed upon by the owner and the Environmental Control Officer. All
tests shall be made under the direction of a professional engineer registered
in the State.
5. _(e)_ Cost of Tests. If the results of the tests indicate that the device is
operating within the limits of this chapter, all costs shall be borne by the
Municipality and the owner, shall not be required to have further tests run for
a period of eighteen months provided no material changes in equipment or
processing have been effected. If the test results indicate a violation, all
costs shall be borne by the owner. This shall be cause for the device to be
sealed by the Environmental Control Officer. Such seal shall remain in effect
until the owner produces satisfactory evidence that the necessary corrective
measures have been taken.
