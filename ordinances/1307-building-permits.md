## 1307.01   Building permits required; application; plans and drawings

Before proceeding with the construction, enlargement, alteration. repair or
removal of any building or other structure, a permit shall be first obtained by
the owner or his agent from the Building Inspector. Such permit must be
obtained before the commencement of any work, including excavations, is
performed on the premises in connection with any construction, enlargement,
alteration, repair or removal of any building or other structure. The
application shall be made in writing and upon printed forms furnished by the
Inspector and shall, except for removals, be accompanied by a complete set of
plans and working drawings conforming to the requirements of Chapter 1305. In addition to the above plans, and where heating equipment is to be
installed, there shall be submitted, at the time of applying for a building
permit, an approved set of heating plans in accordance with Section 1307.15. When plans and drawings are found to conform to the requirements of
this Building Code and the Zoning Code, and such plans and drawings have been
approved by the Architectural Board of Review as provided in Section 137.08 of the Administrative Code, the Inspector shall issue a permit, except
as otherwise provided by ordinance or statute, which permit shall be effective
for one year from the date of its issuance.  
(Ord. 1955-350. Passed 10-10-55.)

## 1307.02   Issuance of permit; certification of compliance with zoning code

Before the issuance of a building permit, the Building Inspector shall
certify in writing upon the plans, or attached thereto, that the building,
alteration or repair proposed to be done thereunder will conform to all of the
provisions of the Zoning Code, including, but not limited to, setback, side and
rear yard requirements and height and floor space requirements.  
(Ord. 1955-350. Passed 10-10-55.)

## 1307.03   Bonds

No building permit shall be issued unless and until the applicant for such
permit deposits with the Director of Finance a cash bond in the amount of one
thousand dollars ($1,000) as a guarantee that adequate protection will be
provided and that no damage will be done to any curb, tree lawn, sidewalk,
ditch or culvert in connection with the construction, enlargement, alteration,
repair or removal of any building. Such deposit shall also guarantee that no
dirt, mud, building material or other nuisance will be deposited or left upon
the streets, sidewalks, tree lawns or in the ditches of the Municipality in
connection with such construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or removal.
If such damage, deposit or nuisance is not corrected or removed by the
permittee, the Building Inspector shall charge the cost thereof to such
depositor. In the event the sum so deposited is not sufficient to pay such cost
and expense, the permittee or the owner of the property shall be liable to the
Municipality for any balance remaining. Such deposit shall also be held by the
Inspector as a guarantee that when any opening is made in any street or public
ground or tree lawn in connection with the work performed pursuant to such
permit, such permittee will promptly and at the proper time, or at such times
as instructed by the Inspector, replace and restore the street, pavement,
sidewalk, tree lawn or other public property over any such opening to as good a
state and condition as found previous to opening the same. Such deposit shall
be held for such purposes and also in accordance with the provisions of Section 1307.11 and the provisions of Chapter 901. Upon the completion of  the work for which a permit has been granted, and
when the Inspector is satisfied that all the conditions and requirements
provided for herein have been satisfied, such deposit or any unused portion
thereof may be returned to the permittee.

Where an application for a permit involves industrial or commercial
construction, the Inspector may require a larger cash bond, not more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000), commensurate with the size of buildings and the
possible damage to public streets, subject to all
of the provisions of this section.  
(Ord. 2006-47. Passed 7-24-06.)

## 1307.04   Permit to erect part of building

The Building Inspector may require complete plans and specifications before
issuing a permit for any part of contemplated work but nothing in this Building
Code shall prevent the Inspector from issuing a permit for the erection of part
of a building or structure, where the plans and detailed statements have been
presented for the same, before the entire plans and detailed statements of such
building or structure have been submitted, provided that a complete set of all
such plans and working drawings as prescribed in Section 1307.01 is placed on file before the foundation wall is brought to grade or to
a height to receive the first tier of beams, girders or joists.  
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1307.05   Permits for superstructure

(Editor’s note: Former Section 1307.05 was repealed by Ordinance 1980-5, passed January 28, 1980.)
  

## 1307.06   Permits for minor interior repairs and alterations

(Editor’s note: Former Section 1307.06 was repealed by Ordinance 1980-5, passed January 28, 1980.)

## 1307.07   Water permit required

No permit for the construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or removal
of any building or structure within this Municipality shall become effective
until the right has been secured from the Chief Administrative Officer or other
proper authority to use the water necessary for the work called for by such
permit, or the necessary water has been otherwise properly contracted for. No
person shall perform any of the work called for by such permit, except
excavating, leveling or any operation not entailing actual construction, before
water has been provided for as required herein.  
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1307.08   Revocation of permit for delay

If construction work for which a building permit has been issued is not
begun within thirty days after the date of the permit, the Building Inspector
may, at his option, cancel the permit or serve notice in writing addressed to
the individual or company to whom the permit was issued providing for such
further notice to the Building Inspector as in his opinion may be necessary
before starting work under the permit. Should work which has been started be
delayed to such an extent, in the judgment of the Inspector, to justify similar
notice regarding recommencing work, he may, at his option, issue notice in the
manner provided for in this section. Failure on the part of those in charge of
such work to comply with such notice shall be considered a violation of this
Building Code. Should the delays, in the judgment of the Inspector, be such as
to justify revocation of the permit, he may revoke the permit by written notice
addressed as above.  
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1307.09   Restoration upon permit revocation

Upon revocation of any building permit all street openings must be properly
backfilled, pavements, sidewalks and tree lawns restored to the condition in
which they were before work was begun and the site of the operations must be
cleared of surplus dirt and refuse and restored to a condition acceptable to
the Building Inspector. Upon failure of those responsible for the operations to
make such repairs and restoration, the Inspector may use so much of the deposit
made in connection with the issuing of the permits as, in his judgment, may be
necessary to repair and restore the street and the site of the operation.
Should the deposit be insufficient to complete the repairs and restoration, the
Inspector may, upon authorization by Council, complete the repairs and
restoration, in which event all costs and expenses, over and above the portion
of the deposit used for this purpose, shall become a lien on the property
described in the building permit.  
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1307.10   Revocation for noncompliance

When, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, work is not being performed
in accordance with approved plans and specifications, or when, in his opinion,
materials or equipment delivered on the work do not conform to standards
provided for in the plans and specifications, or when, in his opinion,
workmanship, materials or equipment are not in conformity with the requirements
of this Building Code, or when the manner of performing any of the work
provided for in the permit is in violation of any ordinance or regulation of
the Municipality, the Inspector may order the discontinuance of all work under
the permit.

If the work is not immediately discontinued or corrected to the satisfaction
of the Inspector, he may revoke the permit. In ordering discontinuance of work
it shall be necessary only that notice be given to the individuals in immediate
charge of the operation which is being improperly performed, or in which the
unsatisfactory materials are being incorporated. If the permit is to be
revoked, it shall be necessary only to mail notice of such revocation to the
individual, firm or corporation in whose name the permit was issued, at the
address named in the application for permit. Failure to comply with the orders
of the Inspector or to discontinue operations immediately after the revocation
of a permit shall be a violation of this Building Code.  
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1307.11   Deposit to cover repairs

It shall be the duty of all those engaged in the work for which a building
permit has been issued to take such precautions as the Building Inspector may
request in the protection of municipal property, including pavements, curbing,
tree lawns, trees, sidewalks and property of adjoining owners. Damage to
municipal property not repaired within five days after notice to repair from
the Inspector may be repaired in such manner as the Inspector may determine and
the cost of such repairs may be deducted from the cash deposited as provided in
Section 1307.03. Should the deposit be insufficient to cover such repairs and all other
work for which it is security, and the resulting deficit is not paid into the
Municipal Treasury within thirty days after completion of the work, such
deficit shall become a lien on the property on which the construction work was
authorized and shall be collected as other taxes are collected. A sum
equivalent to five percent of the cost of repairs made on the authority and
under the direction of the Inspector shall be deducted from the deposit to
reimburse the Municipality for the time and expense involved. Failure to remove
refuse and surplus materials from streets and from that portion of the land
which is immediately adjacent to a public street, within thirty days after the
substantial completion of work, shall constitute authorization to the Inspector
to have such materials and refuse removed. The cost of such removal shall be
assessed and collected in the manner provided for the making of repairs to
municipal property.  
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1307.12   Approval of water or sewer connections; underground water pipes

All water line connections and sanitary sewer connections shall be inspected
and approved by the Chief Administrative Officer or his duly designated
representative.

Underground water pipes between the curb connection and the meter shall be
"Type K-Copper" only.  
(Ord. 1957-420. Passed 12-28-57.)

## 1307.13   Driveway permits

Driveways shall be constructed in the manner specified by the Building
Inspector. The  elevations and grades of that portion of the driveway within
the normal sidewalk  limits must be such as to conform with the grade of the
sidewalks which it adjoins and must provide a  uniform grade. Construction
within the limits of the sidewalk must conform to the requirements of Chapter 903 covering the construction of sidewalks. The entire construction must be
such as not to provide a public hazard.  
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1307.14   Curb cutting permit

Application for permission to cut curbs shall be made to the Chief
Administrative Officer. Permits granted for the work shall specify the
conditions under which the work is to be performed.  
(Ord. 2009-64. Passed 11-9-09.)

## 1307.15   Heating installations

Before the installation of heating equipment or an alteration or addition
thereto of any kind is commenced, there shall be submitted plans showing the
heating installation and all details connected therewith, including the size
and type of unit to be installed. These plans shall be subject to the approval
of the Building Inspector and shall be so approved before the installation is
begun. Plans shall be clearly marked and shall conform to the ordinances of
this Municipality regulating heating.  
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

## 1307.16   Swimming pools

<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. _(a)_ Before proceeding with the installation, construction or excavation
for a permanent swimming pool, a permit shall first be obtained from the
Building Inspector by the owner of  the property upon which such swimming pool
is to be installed, in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code and
Building Code.
2. _(b)_ Before a swimming pool permit is issued, a plot plan shall be
submitted showing the location of the swimming pool with respect to lot lines
and buildings; there shall also be submitted a list of materials and a
description of the method of construction and the dimensions of the pool.  
(Ord. 1959-466. Passed 9-14-59.)
3. _(c)_ (Editor’s note: Former subsection (c) was repealed by Ordinance 2019-
65, passed November 25, 2019.)

## 1307.17   Partition fence or wall

A building permit shall be obtained for any fence or wall.  
(Ord. 1995-18. Passed 4-10-95.)

## 1307.18   Minor building permits

In all cases where repairs, alterations, additions or construction are of a
minor, unimportant and nonextensive character and are of such nature that, in
the judgment of the Building Inspector, public interest does not require
inspection, a "minor building permit" shall be issued.

All operations involving less than 100 square feet of floor surface shall be
embodied under this classification of minor building permits.

In such cases no fee shall be charged beyond a twenty dollar ($20.00) fee to
cover the cost of making a record thereof and the time and detail involved in
the issuance of a permit.

Mere replacements of material of a minor nature may be made and installed
without any permit.  
(Ord. 1980-5. Passed 1-28-80; Ord. 1990-79. Passed 10-8-90; Ord. 2005-28. 
Passed 6-13-05.)

## 1307.19   Preliminary plot plan required

In addition to all other requirements of the Building and Zoning Codes of
the Municipality, the County and the State, each applicant for a permit to
construct a new building or structure, or to remodel or reconstruct an existing
building or structure wherein the existing grade of the lot or building is
proposed to be changed, or any person seeking to change the grade of any
property by more than three inches, shall submit to the Building Department a
plot plan of the property, prepared by a registered engineer or a registered

Prior to filing an application for a certificate of occupancy under the
Zoning Code, each applicant shall first file with the Building Inspector a
final plot plan, which plot plan shall show the final grades of the improvement
as constructed. Such plans shall be certified by a registered engineer or
surveyor as to the accuracy of the plans depicting the actual construction and
further certification that he has made actual field observation of as-built
conditions and these conditions are as shown on the plans. The form of such
certification shall be prescribed by the Municipal Engineer.  
(Ord. 1978-1129. Passed 10-23-78.)

## 1307.21   Building inspector’s fees

The Building Inspector is hereby authorized and directed to charge
applicants for building permits a fee based on the following schedule for each
building permit application, in addition to the normal building permit fee,
which fee shall be deposited in the General Fund of the Municipality:

informed; the applicant shall be directed to deposit the difference, if any,
between the Municipal Engineer’s estimate and the applicant’s original payment
which difference shall be paid prior to any issuance of the building permit.
Any difference between the final cost of the grade plan review and the

In addition to the requirements contained in any other section of the
Codified Ordinances or Building Code of the Municipality, wherever the plot
plan filed under other sections of the Code fails to indicate a method of the
positive draining of surface water from the lot, the Engineer shall notify the
Building Department of such failure and may further recommend to such applicant
and prescribe the method of drainage to be provided, which recommendation and
prescription the applicant shall have incorporated into such plot plan and
shall thereupon resubmit the plot plan so amended for approval.  
(Ord. 1978-1129. Passed 10-23-78.)

## 1307.23   Appeals

<p class="Markdown-list--a-1-A"></p>

1. _(a)_ Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, determination, or any
other action by the Village in relation to any provision of the Building Code
of the Village of Chagrin Falls may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals
within ten (10) days of such official action. Such an appeal shall be made in
conformity with Chapter 1111 of the Planning and Zoning Code to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Written
notice of appeal shall be served upon the Village by serving its Chief
Administrative Officer. The right to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals
from any action regarding the Building Code shall conform to the provisions
contained in this section, even if there is another provision or regulation in
the Building Code which authorizes appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
2. _(b)_ The Chief Administrative Officer shall create one or more forms to be
utilized by any person who intends to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals any
order, requirement, determination or other action regarding the Building Code
of Chagrin Falls, but the failure to provide  such form or forms shall not
prohibit or impede the right of any aggrieved person to file an appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals so long as the aggrieved person provides a description
of the action that it being appealed, the date of the official action, and any
applicable Building Code provisions that are the subject of the appeal. The
filing fee for any appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals regarding the Building
Code of Chagrin Falls shall be the same fee for any similar appeal to the Board
of Zoning Appeals regarding the Planning and Zoning Code of Chagrin Falls.
3. _(c)_
    1. Whenever any appeal is made to the Board of Zoning Appeals from
any provision, regulation, order, requirement, determination or any other
action by the Village in relation to the Building Code, the standard of review
for any appeal regarding an area  regulation shall be the same as provided for
area variances found in Section 1111.07(c) of the Planning and Zoning Code.
    2. _(2)_ Whenever the appeal relates to seeking a variance from required
construction materials or methods, the standard of review shall be as follows:
        1. _(A)_ The variance was not self-created.
        2. _(B)_ Relief will not violate the spirit of the Building Code.
        3. _(C)_ The requested variance is the minimum necessary to avoid an
unnecessary hardship.
        4. _(D)_ Relief will not compromise or reduce (i) the health or safety of
persons who will construct, occupy, inhabit, or visit such building or
structure , or (ii) the health or safety of persons and property in the general
vicinity of the property that is the subject of the appeal.
4. _(d)_ Whenever an appeal is taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals from a
decision or interpretation of an official of the Village regarding the Building
Code, alleging error by such official, the Board of Zoning Appeals may affirm,
modify and affirm, or reverse such decision in the event that it determines the
decision was illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable or unsupported by the
preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole
record. 
5. _(e)_ Advice of Expert on Economic Feasibility. If, in reviewing a request
for a variance, or an appeal alleging error by an official of the Village,
relating to the Building Code, the Administrator or Chairman of the Board of
Zoning Appeals determines that  the advice of an expert in applying building
codes or construction of buildings and structures is necessary to assist in the
analysis of determining whether or not the variance request or any appeal
alleging error is appropriate and if in applying the  standard of review
confirms that relief is appropriate, the Administrator  shall  engage an expert
at the applicant’s expense, to provide such advice. The Administrator may
require the applicant to deposit a sum estimated to cover the cost to have the
expert provide such advice and attend any hearing or meeting.  
(Ord. 2020-38. Passed 9-14-20.)

## 1307.99   Penalty
