    2. {% comment -%} (2) {%- endcomment -%} Co-op Programs. Contracts authorized pursuant to the Ohio
Department of Administrative Services Cooperative Purchasing Program, or any
other similar program ("cooperative program"), or goods, materials or equipment

single source;
    6. {% comment -%} (6) {%- endcomment -%} No Bids/Rejected Bids. If no bids are received after the
advertisements or other solicitations required by this chapter, or if all bids
are rejected, the Mayor shall either seek new, competitive bids, or seek to

services or for any other lawful purpose. The Mayor shall notify Council of
such expenditure at the next meeting of Council.
7. {% comment -%} (g) {%- endcomment -%} Time Between Notice of Public Bidding and Bid Opening.  There shall be
no minimum time requirement between the publishing of the notice of public

this period invalidates the entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted,
unless the time for awarding and executing the contract is extended by mutual

respect to whom the Village subsequently awards and executes a contract.  Such
an agreed extension shall not entitle the contractor to delay costs. 
10. {% comment -%} (j) {%- endcomment -%} Withdrawal of Bids.  Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant Section 9.31

for its convenience.
13. {% comment -%} (m) {%- endcomment -%} Retainage.  Retainage shall be withheld from payments to the
