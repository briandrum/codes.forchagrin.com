## 765.01   Intent

The purpose of this chapter is to permit and encourage sidewalk use that is
compatible with other public uses of the public sidewalk. The Village finds
that sidewalk cafes encourage a pedestrian-oriented environment, help to create
a visually attractive atmosphere and promote overall commerce. Regulations and
standards for the existence and operation of sidewalk cafes are necessary to
facilitate and ensure a safe environment in these areas. The issuance of a
sidewalk cafe permit shall not constitute nor shall it be construed to
constitute a vacation or abandonment by the Village of its interest in the
right-of-way or any easements contained therein.   
(Ord. 2007-23. Passed 3-26-07.)

## 765.02   Definitions

1. _(a)_ "Abutting property owners and occupants" means any owner or occupant

between the curb line and the property line demarcated by extending the side
