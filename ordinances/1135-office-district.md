## 1135.01   Intent

In addition to the provisions of the intent stated in Section 1105.03, it is the
intent of these district regulations to promote office development appropriately
designed and located to achieve, among others, the following objectives:

1. _(a)_ To provide opportunities for local employment;

2. _(b)_ To stimulate the local economy and to generate local tax revenues; and

3. _(c)_ To limit retail sales and retail services so as to prevent a decline of
such uses in the Municipal center where they are more appropriately located.

4. _(d)_ To permit development, which by virtue of its characteristic traffic
generation, hours of operation and noise levels, may serve as an appropriate
transitional use between residential areas and nearby retail or industrial
areas.

3. _(c)_ Modifications to Yard and Setback Requirements.

    1. _(1)_ Front yards. The Planning and Zoning Commission may reduce the
    required front yard setback to permit proposed buildings in substantially
    built up blocks to meet prevailing setbacks if such alignment is deemed more
    appropriate 

    2. _(2)_ Side yards. Buildings on adjoining lots may be attached at side lot
    lines if approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Architectural
    Board of Review in consideration of planning and design standards and a
    recorded common wall agreement is entered into by the owners in form and
    content first approved by the Law Director.

    3. _(3)_ Buffers. The Planning and Zoning Commission may eliminate buffer
    requirements at side and rear lot lines joining nonresidential uses in order
    to permit shared drive and parking facilities. Such action shall be taken
    only if it is determined that site design or safety will be improved as a
    result. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall require the submission of 
    written reciprocal agreements between the property owners, which shall be
    recorded with the County Recorder, guaranteeing the observance of all
    required conditions for the life of the shared driving and/or parking
    facilities, which agreement shall be reviewed and subject to the approval of
    the Law Director, which agreements shall name the Municipality as a third
    party beneficiary of the agreements with the right to enforce such
    reciprocal agreements.

not more than six feet into a required rear yard.
