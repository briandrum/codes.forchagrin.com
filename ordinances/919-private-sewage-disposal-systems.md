1. _(a)_ Compliance Required. Where a public sanitary sewer is not available
under the provisions of Section 911.02(d), the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal
system complying with the provisions of this chapter.
2. _(b)_ Permit; Application; Fee. Before commencement of construction of a
private sewage disposal system, the owner shall first obtain a written permit

shall be made on a form furnished by such Board of Health. A permit and
inspection fee shall be paid to such Board at the time the application is
filed.
3. _(c)_ Inspection. A permit for a private sewage disposal system shall not
become effective until the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the
Cuyahoga County Board of Health. The Board shall be allowed to inspect the work
at any stage of construction and, in any event, the applicant for the permit
shall notify the Board when the work is ready for final inspection and before

twenty-four hours of receipt of notice by the Board.
4. _(d)_ Standards. The type, capacities, location and layout of a private
sewage disposal system shall comply with all recommendations of the State
Department of Public Health. No permit shall be issued for any private sewage
disposal system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area
of the lot is less than 10,000 square feet with public water or 20,000 square
feet without public water. No septic tank or cesspool shall be permitted to
discharge into any natural outlet.
5. _(e)_ Connection to Sewer Required When Available. At such time as a public
sewer becomes available to a property served by a private sewage disposal
system, as provided in subsection (d) hereof, a direct connection shall be made
to the public sewer in compliance with this chapter, and any septic tanks,
cesspools and similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned and
filled with suitable material.
6. _(f)_ Operation. The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage
disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the
Municipality.
7. _(g)_ Requirements of Health Officer. No statement contained in this chapter
shall be construed to interfere with any additional requirements that may be
imposed by the County Health Officer.
8. _(h)_ Abandonment of Systems. When a public sewer becomes available, the
building sewer shall be connected to such sewer within sixty days and the
private sewage disposal system shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with clean
