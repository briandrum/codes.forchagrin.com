## 1130.01   Intent

In addition to the applicable provisions of the intent stated in Section 1105.03, it is the intent of these district regulations to promote development
of a mix of residential uses properly designed and located to achieve, among
others, the following objectives:

1. _(a)_ To permit residential development that may serve as an appropriate
transitional use between existing residential and nonresidential uses.
2. _(b)_ To offer greater flexibility in the mix of permitted residential uses.
3. _(c)_ To allow development on large sites within close proximity to the
Municipal center.
4. _(d)_ To encourage development to take place that will make efficient use of
existing Municipal infrastructure and services.  
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)

## 1130.02   Standards

For the purpose of this chapter, the following standards shall apply:

1. _(a)_ Ownership and Maintenance of Private Roads. Private roads proposed to
be constructed shall be clearly delineated on the site plan together with the
descriptive data as to the compliance with the regulations of Chapter 1161 and the methods proposed for maintaining the private road. All private
roads shown on the site plan shall be subject to legally enforceable
reservations and restrictions acceptable to the Municipal government, which
will ensure the preservation of the private road in perpetuity.
2. _(b)_ Measurement of Front Lot Line on Private Roads. The front yard
setback shall be measured from the edge of the pavement or back of the curb.
3. _(c)_ Supplemental Regulations.  Private roads shall be constructed in
accordance with regulations set forth in Chapter 1161. In those cases where no request for public dedication is likely to be
made, the Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize modifications to the
requirements of Chapter 1161. Such authorization may be based on input from the Administrator,
Municipal Engineer and other Municipal officers as applicable.

    1. _(1)_ "Main wall" means any exterior wall(s) of a residential building
containing the principal windows of a living, dining or sleeping room or rooms.
    2. _(2)_ "Secondary wall" means any exterior wall(s) of a residential
building, other than a main wall, containing minor windows of a dining or
sleeping room, principal or minor windows of a kitchen or bathroom or no
window.
    3. _(3)_ "Overlapping walls" means a wall of one building in relation to a
wall of a second building when perpendicular lines extended from that wall
intersect with the second wall.
    4. _(4)_ "Length of overlap" means the length of the portion of one wall
from which perpendicular lines will intersect a second wall. In determining
the length of overlap, the minimum possible overlap shall be used for
computation.
    5. _(5)_ "Facing walls."  Although more than one set of walls may be
"overlapping" in the relationship between two buildings, only one set of two
walls shall be considered "facing".  "Facing walls" means those two overlapping
walls for which the length of the overlap is the greater.
2. _(b)_ Schedule of Distances. The minimum distance between walls of main
buildings and other walls or uses shall be as set forth in the following
schedule:
Building Wall               Other Wall or Use          Minimum Distance (feet)
Main wall, facing:          Another main wall          40+x
                            Secondary wall             30+x
                            Accessory building         30

    1. _(1)_ Attractive variations in facade, width, color, exterior materials
and roof lines shall be deemed desirable; furthermore, parallel arrangements of
buildings should be avoided.
    2. _(2)_ In order to enhance privacy and encourage attractive building
arrangements for ASF dwellings, the alignment of buildings should be varied and
the facades of not more than every two dwelling units shall be offset by at
least sixteen inches. No more than eight units shall be located in one
building.
    3. _(3)_ Buildings may be attached if it is determined by the Planning and
Zoning Commission  that site design will be improved as a result. However,
attached buildings shall be designed with visible offsets or setbacks not less
than six feet in depth or with substantial variations in alignment.
2. _(b)_ Site Design. Developments shall be designed to complement the
topography of the land in order to utilize natural contours, economize in the
construction of utilities, reduce required grading and maximize the
conservation of trees, watercourses and other natural features. Natural
features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be integrated
into the plan to create functional variations in the arrangements of dwellings,
open spaces and accessory uses.
3. _(c)_ Modifications to Area, Yard and Buffer Requirements. With respect to
properties of irregular shape, or unusual topography relative to other lots in
the same zoning district, the Planning and Zoning Commission may modify
requirements regarding areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses if
compliance with these requirements is either clearly infeasible or contrary to
compliance with the design regulations and standards of this section. However,
the maximum permitted density shall not be increased by reason of this
provision. Applicants shall first seek modifications under this section prior
to filing an application as set forth in Section 1111.03 for a variance for areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses. 
4. _(d)_ Common Open Space.  As required in Section 1130.04(d), at least ten percent (10%) of the total area of the development
shall be reserved as common open space in ASF developments and shall comply
with the requirements of Section 1127.07(d) of this Planning and Zoning Code.
5. _(e)_ Pedestrian Circulation. Each ASF development shall be served by a
comprehensive walkway system, adequately separated from vehicular circulation,
connecting residential buildings to parking and recreation areas.
6. _(f)_ Utility Equipment. All utility lines serving a mixed use residential
development shall be located underground. All rooftop mechanical equipment
shall be enclosed in a manner which complements the architectural style of the
building on which it is located. (Ord.  2016-59. Passed 11-14-16.)
7. _(g)_ Accessory Structures.
    1. _(1)_ R1/R2:  Accessory structures are permitted as regulated in Section 1125.04.

rating of one (1) ton or less may be parked in a driveway provided that no part
of any vehicle may extend over any public sidewalk or other right of way and
that such truck is used solely by the occupant of the dwelling.
3. _(c)_ Prohibited Activity. The rebuilding, overhauling or dismantling of an
automotive vehicle or the storage of motor or body parts in an open yard is
prohibited. The outside parking and storage of recreational vehicles is
prohibited.
4. _(d)_ ASF: Garages. Each garage shall be provided for the exclusive use of
a single dwelling unit and shall be attached to the residential structure which
contains that unit. Such garages may be attached to one another at side walls
in order to improve design.
5. _(e)_ ASF.
    1. _(1)_ In addition to the parking required in Chapter 1141 , a minimum of one-half (0.5) off-street parking space per dwelling unit
shall be provided in unenclosed common parking areas distributed throughout
