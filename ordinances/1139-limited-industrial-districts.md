## 1139.01   Intent

In addition to the applicable provisions of the intent stated in Section 1105.03, it is the intent of these district regulations to promote limited
industrial development appropriately designed and located to achieve, among
others, the following objectives:
     (a)       To provide opportunities for local employment.
     (b)       To stimulate the local economy and generate local tax revenues.
     (c)       To minimize the impact of limited industrial uses on surrounding
uses.
     (d)       To encourage development to take place that will make efficient
use of existing infrastructure and services.
     (e)       To limit permitted industrial uses to those most compatible with
the predominantly small-scale, residential character of the community.
